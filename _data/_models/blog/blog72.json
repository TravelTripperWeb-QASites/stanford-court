  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s that time of the year again, the most special day in May, the one where you take mom out for an afternoon on the town. But although you&rsquo;ve had all year to prepare, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s gotten any easier to figure out where you should go this year, much less what to get her. However, if there&rsquo;s one thing that San Francisco knows it&rsquo;s brunch and beautiful scenery. That said, here are some ideas for the perfect Mother&rsquo;s Day in SF.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Brunch at Leo&rsquo;s Oyster Bar</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Brunch is the first thing that comes to mind on Mother&rsquo;s Day - and brunch at <a href=\"http://leossf.com/\">Leo&rsquo;s Oyster Bar</a> is always top of mind in SF. Located in the heart of the Financial District, this classy joint pulls off vintage tropical without the slightest bit of kitsch. Plan for caviar and champagne, ice-cold oysters and a walk down memory lane.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Go Off the Grid at the Presidio Picnic</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Now, if Mom is more of the no-frills, have-a-good-time type, take her to the Presidio Picnic by the food truck party extraordinaires <a href=\"https://offthegrid.com/\">Off the Grid</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t been to one of Off the Grid&rsquo;s local markets, you need to. Not only do they lure tons of the best local food trucks, they also bring local musicians, and even games. This is especially great if you want to get the entire family together, grandkids included. No arguing over what to eat here. Here you have all of the food under the sun - and overlooking the Presidio.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">See Monet @ Legion of Honor</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Is Mom an art buff? If so put on your museum shoes and head to widely acclaimed exhibition &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/monet-the-early-years-legion-of-honor/\">Monet: The Early Years</a>&rdquo; at the Legion of Honor. This might be your last chance. This collection of lesser known pieces is on the tail end of its showing. And no matter how many times you&rsquo;ve seen Monet, you both most likely haven&rsquo;t see these rare pieces of the master in his formative years. This is one show that&rsquo;s well worth it. The exhibition ends May 29.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Picnic at Huntington Square Park</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Looking to have a heart-to-heart with Mom? Then make the short walk up to Huntington Square Park &nbsp;and spend the day lounging in the grass. Grab a few sandwiches from <a href=\"http://lebeaumarket.com/\">Le Beau Market</a> in Nob Hill, or pick and choose your meats and cheeses, along with a baguette and California cab (#duh) and make up for lost time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Want to do something special for Mom this Mother&rsquo;s Day? Treat her to a trip to San Francisco this summer in honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love. Stanford Court Hotel is running some mad specials. Check them out <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">here</a>.</em></p>"
