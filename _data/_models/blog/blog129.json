  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">While we love all of the offerings in Nob Hill, the Embarcadero has a special place in our hearts and is often one of the main attractions we encourage visitors to explore. It is one of the liveliest and most scenic areas in San Francisco, and a great place for a stroll along the waterfront looking out over the Bay. The Embarcadero begins at the intersection of Second and King Streets near AT&amp;T Park, and travels north, passing under the Bay Bridge. The Embarcadero continues north past the Ferry Building at Market Street, Pier 39, and Fisherman's Wharf, before ending at Pier 45.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here are some of our favorite places to check out when strolling or biking along the Embarcadero:</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">AT&amp;T Park</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Home of our beloved San Francisco Giants, AT&amp;T Park is bustling with orange and black during baseball season and is popping with energy during the off-season with concerts, Opera in the Park, and private events. During season we recommend going on an off-day and entering the park for free to see what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Cupid&rsquo;s Span</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s impossible to miss this stunning and large piece of art by renonwed artist Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. This 60 feet sculpture is a great photo op and so romantic for a proposal. The artists stated that the piece was inspired by San Francisco's reputation as the home port of Eros</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Exploratorium</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">After moving from the Palace of Fine Arts location to their beautiful waterfront location at Pier 15 in 2013. The Exploratorium is a public learning laboratory in San Francisco exploring the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. Children and Adults of all ages love the learning exhibits and visitors can spend an entire day there.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">In-n-Out</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">While you might stroll along the Embarcadero so you can get some delicious sourdough and seafood, visitors cannot resist In-n-Out&rsquo;s iconic double-double. It&rsquo;s the perfect pitstop to get the taste of what many describe the best burger in the world.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ferry Building</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We can go on and on about how much we love the Ferry Building, but you can read our previous posts about the Ferry Building <a title=\"here\" href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/localtips-for-optimizing-your-ferry-building-experince/\">here</a> and <a title=\"here\" href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/five-things-you-must-try-ferry-building/\">here</a>.</p>",
