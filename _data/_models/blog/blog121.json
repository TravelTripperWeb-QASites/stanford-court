Even free things.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">So, as is becoming an SCH monthly tradition, we&rsquo;re here to highlight a few things coming up this month that will cost you #zerodollars. Plan ahead, pack a lunch, and <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/amenities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even borrow one of our bikes</a> and all these events will cost you is the calories you burn getting to them. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hardly Strictly</a> is a free gathering in Golden Gate Park and features more than 90 acts on 7 stages.
