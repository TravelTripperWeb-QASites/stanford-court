We&rsquo;re talking, of course, about <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Masonic</a>, an icon mid-century modernist memorial temple at 1111 California Street. The temple houses the Masonic Auditorium, the Grand Lodge of California, and the Henry W. Coil Library and Museum. It&rsquo;s also a great place to experience groundbreaking <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/dr-jordan-peterson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thinkers</a> and hilarious <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/miranda-sings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comedians</a>. Here are some upcoming concerts to put on your must-see list.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Breeders</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Touring in support of their fifth album &mdash; and their first in a decade &mdash; <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/the-breeders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Breeders</a> will be at The Masonic on April 8th. You can <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/AllNerve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hear the new album here</a>. Entitled &ldquo;All Nerve,&rdquo; the album reunites band members Kim and Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, and Jim Macpherson &mdash; the line-up behind the iconic and platinum-selling record, Last Splash. The quartet returned to the stage in 2013 to celebrate the album&rsquo;s 20th anniversary and have been quietly working on new material since then.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Revivalists</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Fresh off sold-out headlining tours in 2015, 2016, and 2017, <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/the-revivalists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Revivalists</a> will be at The Masonic on May 26th. The Revivalists are celebrating their tenth anniversary as a band and their breakout hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Pt7M0weUI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wish I Knew You</a> continues to inspire new fans. Though the album was released in July of 2015 (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Alternative Albums chart), the song has experienced a rare and undeniable staying power, spending over 40 weeks on the Billboard Adult Alternative Chart where it peaked at #1 and maintained for multiple weeks. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Enanitos Verdes and Hombres G</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Two of the most iconic Latin pop-rock groups from the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/enanitos-verdes-hombres-g/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enanitos Verdes and Hombres G</a> will bring their &ldquo;Huevos Revueltos&rdquo; Tour to The Masonic on June 3. If there is something Enanitos Verdes and Hombres G have in common, it&rsquo;s their long list of huge hits that never get old. Their timeless songs have become unforgettable anthems for generations and their concerts are full of energy and unforgettable moments filled with their catchy melodies and musical nostalgia for their fans across the world.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Erasure</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">English synthpop duo <a href=\"http://sfmasonic.com/event/erasure-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erasure</a> will be at The Masonic on August 17th. Their latest record <em>World Beyond</em> is a post-classical re-recording of their previous album <em>World Be Gone</em>. It was recorded in just ten days by Andy Bell and seven musicians from the Brussels-based Echo Collectives. The tracks featured on World Beyond show award-winning songwriters Vince Clarke and Andy Bell in a more reflective mood, giving the world and recent political upheavals a thoughtful examination. Watch a short film made during the recording sessions at Jet Studio in Brussels <a href=\"http://po.st/ErasureBeyond\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">So when you visit us this spring at Stanford Court Hotel, great live shows are just an easy walk to The Masonic. See you soon!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><br /></p>"
