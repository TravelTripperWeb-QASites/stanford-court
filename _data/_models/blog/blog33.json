Here are the best places in the Nob Hill area to watch the games.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hotel Room </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay in your pajamas and avoid the crowds in the comfort of your room. We have 42&rdquo;</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tvs in every room and food delivery is&nbsp;is just a click away with apps such as Caviar and Uber Eats.
