  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Like many great cities, San Francisco is both modern and classic. Modern because of those attributes that give SF its edge in contemporary life, like the city&rsquo;s tech culture and art community. And classic for all the reasons you already know &mdash;&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.goldengatebridge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">painted ladies</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_(San_Francisco)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lombard Street</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.sfcablecar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cable cars</a>, and, of course, our very own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nob_Hill,_San_Francisco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nob Hill</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, we&rsquo;re here to talk about the classic side of SF you may not know &mdash;&nbsp;the restaurants. As we&rsquo;ve noted before, <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/5-new-sf-restaurants-you-need-to-devour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there are new restaurants</a> that are well worth your time. But if you&rsquo;re looking for the tested, the true, the reliably delicious side of San Francisco, well, here it is. These restaurants have been around so long they are San Francisco. Enjoy!</p>\n<h3>Tommy's Joynt</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 1947, <a href=\"http://tommysjoynt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tommy's Joynt</a> has a no-frills atmosphere and incredible sandwiches &mdash;&nbsp;but no credit cards and no happy hour. So bring cash and be ready to have a good time because the drinks are priced reasonably no matter the hour and cold hard cash keeps the line moving. The cooks arrive at 6 am every day to prepare the meat they&rsquo;ll cut right before your eyes as they create, perhaps, the best sandwich you&rsquo;ve ever tasted.</p>\n<h3>Tadich Grill</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadich_Grill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">166-year-old restaurant</a> &mdash;&nbsp;but the seafood is always fresh. <a href=\"http://www.tadichgrillsf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tadich Grill</a> is always alive with energetic staff and excited patrons. The food is so great, it&rsquo;s reeled in the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Jack Nicholson, and George Lucas. One taste, and you&rsquo;ll know why.</p>\n<h3>Sears Fine Food</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ben Sears was a retired circus clown, who over the years, built a reputation for serving Swedish pancakes made from a recipe inherited from his wife&rsquo;s Swedish family. So, naturally, in 1938, he and his brother, Hilber, founded <a href=\"http://www.searsfinefood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sears Fine Food</a>. But don&rsquo;t let the history fool you &mdash; this place is no joke. The brunch menu is second to none and even <a href=\"https://archives.sfweekly.com/foodie/2015/09/04/old-school-san-francisco-sears-fine-food\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tony Bennett himself called it &ldquo;the best in town!&rdquo;</a></p>\n<h3>Pinecrest Diner</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Founded in 1969, <a href=\"http://www.pinecrestdiner.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinecrest Diner</a> is the oldest standing&nbsp;24-hour diner in Union Square. Walk through the door &mdash; literally at any time &mdash;&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ll find delicious food waiting. The basics &mdash; scrambled eggs, a juicy burger or an endless cup of joe &mdash;&nbsp;never tasted so good. The restaurant was completely renovated in 2010 but maintains its same nostalgic feel &mdash;&nbsp;and great food.</p>\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",
