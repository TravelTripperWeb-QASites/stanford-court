For those with an untrained Bufano eye, his presence is less obvious. It can go totally unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was the case until last month at <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">Stanford Court</a>. The Italian-born artist&rsquo;s 3-ton, 10-foot tall penguin statue went unseen by most guests behind a retaining wall on the hotel grounds&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Taking-a-citywide-census-of-Benny-Bufano-11745259.php#photo-13633086\">until it was pulled out with a crane</a>. Its restoration is now complete, and we look forward to showcasing the historic work front and center in our courtyard in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>But before that happens, here is some backstory on the beloved local artist.</p>\n<p>Beniamino Bufano, nicknamed &ldquo;Bene,&rdquo; first came to San Francisco to work at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama%E2%80%93Pacific_International_Exposition\">world&rsquo;s fair in 1915</a> (note to history buffs: this specific fair was in celebration of the completion of the Panama Canal). He fell in love with SF and returned years later, <a href=\"http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Beniamino_Bufano_on_Public_Art\">making art pieces for the city</a>. He accepted mere day wages for his work and sought to create public works that were &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Beniamino_Bufano_on_Public_Art\">big enough to belong to everybody, too big for anyone to put in his pocket and call his own</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was a colorful man who stood just 5 feet tall and was inspired by St. Francis of Assisi and philosophers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen\">Sun Yat-sen</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey\">John Dewey</a>.</p>\n<p>Bufano worked with mostly stone and mosaics. He created many sculptures of animals, from butterflies to bears, cats, seals and butterflies. The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Taking-a-citywide-census-of-Benny-Bufano-11745259.php#photo-13633086\">San Francisco Chronicle counted 58 of Bufano&rsquo;s works</a> in San Francisco, with 16 city-owned, and many others that are kept in hospitals, colleges and churches. Sixteen busts reside in the <a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/\">MOMA</a>. A small collection is also honored in <a href=\"http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/bufano-valencia-gardens.html\">Valencia Gardens</a>, an affordable housing site in The Mission. Other works of his can be seen in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_Park_Historic_District\">Aquatic Park district</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He is also characterized by his &ldquo;peace totems,&rdquo; towering sculptures of openness and peace. A notable statue is the <a href=\"http://www.calexplornia.com/bufano-peace-statue-monument/\">8-story tall, 6,000-lb &ldquo;Peace&rdquo;</a> statue that overlooks Timber Cove, California, on the Sonoma Coast.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing more works of Bufano&rsquo;s, just two blocks away from Stanford Court at St. Mary&rsquo;s Square stands his <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@37.7919882,-122.4054185,3a,90y,222.93h,102.77t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOJ1NwBlBf3FtzbuT1q_XBKJXXuGRnNHO0OdB7K!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOJ1NwBlBf3FtzbuT1q_XBKJXXuGRnNHO0OdB7K%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-10.949902-ya5.499999-ro-0-fo100!7i10240!8i5120\">statue of Sun Yat-sen</a>.
