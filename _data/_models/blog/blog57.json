Following along with our monthly series, here are the apps we&rsquo;re downloading this month @ SCH:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">RunGo</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This is a great app. <a href=\"https://www.rungoapp.com/\">RunGo</a> mixes our love of running and travel, customizing new routes and organizing tours. RunGo offers users different scenic routes in multiple cities, as well as turn-by-turn voice navigation. And it tracks distance, time, and elevation. It&rsquo;s the best way to see a city - without looking like a tourist, and while getting a workout in the process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Food Genie</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">How often do you have trouble deciding on restaurant? Or when it comes time for dinner, do you forget all the great restaurants in the neighborhood? If you&rsquo;re like us, it&rsquo;s all the time. That&rsquo;s where <a href=\"http://www.foodgenieapp.com/\">Food Genie</a> comes in. Food Genie teams up with Yelp to be the unbiased decision-maker. Just set the filters - distance, cuisine, and price - and spin the wheel. Food Genie chooses for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Popcorn</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&rsquo;s another genius app. With <a href=\"https://getpopcorn.io/\">Popcorn</a>, no longer will you be spending countless hours scrolling through Netflix trying to find something decent. Popcorn has organized thousands of movies by every possible category. Think &ldquo;20 Best Golden Globe Winners&rdquo; to &ldquo;Top 10 Will Ferrell Movies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Best Movies to Netflix and Chill.&rdquo; Finding a movie has never been easier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Supersonic</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For those of you who already type in more emojis that actually letters, this new messaging app is right up your alley. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/03/16/google-supersonic-voice-emoji/\">Supersonic</a> not only transcribes voice messages into text, it translates to emojis wherever possible. It&rsquo;s one of the latest apps to come out of Area 120, Google&rsquo;s creative think tank. Try it out. It&rsquo;s fun to play around with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Like what you're reading?
