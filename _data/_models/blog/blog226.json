In the past, we&rsquo;ve taken our guests on a <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/a-day-san-francisco-nob-hill-neighborhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-guided day tour</a>, highlighting the <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/neighborhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best sights in Nob Hill</a>. This time, we&rsquo;re catering to the gourmands out there. Stanford Court is within walking distance of eateries serving local produce and fresh ingredients. All you need to experience a culinary delight is right here. Join us!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Morning</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Start your day right by grabbing breakfast at our own <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/dining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Commons Cafe</a>. Though there&rsquo;s nothing common about it! The coffee is locally sourced from Marin County &mdash; just across the bay from San Francisco &mdash; and expertly brewed, as it should be. When it comes to food, you have two options. A continental breakfast buffet for $22, which includes fresh seasonal fruit, fresh baked pastries, coffee and deli meat and cheese. If you&rsquo;d rather a larger breakfast, choose the full buffet for $28 and tuck into a hearty selection of scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausages and more.</p>\n<h3>Afternoon</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spend the rest of the morning <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/explore-nob-hill-on-foot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exploring Nob Hill on foot</a> &mdash; and walking off the breakfast. If you&rsquo;re visiting the <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/stanford-court-guide-2-nob-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cable Car Museum</a>, you&rsquo;ll be a couple of blocks away from the Nook. This neighborhood cafe serves light sandwiches, healthy food plates and organic salads, with vegan options. It&rsquo;s also a perfect spot to get your afternoon coffee fix while watching the cable cars from a sunny sidewalk table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1542179103056\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/large_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" alt=\"close-up-of-two-glazed-donuts-in-nob-hill\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/large_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/medium_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/small_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/xsmall_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020419/thumb_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-donuts.png\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next stop is Bob&rsquo;s Donuts, a haven for anyone with a sweet tooth and a craving for classic, handmade pastries. But what makes Bob&rsquo;s Donuts so special isn&rsquo;t its long history &mdash; it was opened in the 1960s &mdash; but the sense of community that lingers in the store alongside the delicious scent of freshly baked goods.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;d rather have a savory treat, Swan Oyster Depot is just down the street from Bob&rsquo;s Donuts. Serving fresh and high-quality seafood, this is a SF gem. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged by the queues. We promise that the oyster plates, clam chowders, Maine lobsters and smoked fish dishes will be unlike any you&rsquo;ve eaten before.</p>\n<h3>Evening</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finish your day of gastronomic exploration by having dinner at Sons &amp; Daughters, a Michelin-starred restaurant. This locale brings together what we love about Nob Hill&rsquo;s food scene: an intimate setting, local ingredients, creative dishes in the hands of visionary chefs and exclusive wines selected by expert sommeliers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1542179176938\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/large_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" alt=\"selection-of-two-craft-beers-in-nob-hill-seven-stills\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/large_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/medium_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/small_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/xsmall_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21117/media/2018-11-14-020536/thumb_stanford-court-eat-in-nob-hill-seven-stills.png\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a full day of culinary bliss, grab a nightcap in <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/dining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seven Stills</a>, a swanky distillery and brewery located right at Stanford Court! Forget about the late-night cab fare. Relish in the convenience of tasting locally-brewed craft beer and whiskey, partying until you drop and then, taking the elevator to your room.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you looking for more <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San Francisco tips and travel inspiration</a>?
