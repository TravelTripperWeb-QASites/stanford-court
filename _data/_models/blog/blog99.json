Like a little taste of what you can discover and love about SF.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You probably already know about the big things. The charming architecture, iconic cable cars, beautiful bridges, and the rolling-yet-very-walkable city hills that make SF so gr8.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In this city, you never know what you&rsquo;ll discover over the next crest or around the next bend in the road. The little things. The big-but-hidden things.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So we&rsquo;ll have to give you a sneak peek. Here are five interesting, fun, and oh-so-San Francisco oddities that will help you understand why people love this place. And why you&rsquo;ll love it too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1502259036495\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/large_mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/medium_mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/small_mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/xsmall_mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-020715/thumb_mosaic-staircase-san-francisco-16th-avenue.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">1. The 16th Avenue Staircase</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The reward for visiting this SF gem is two-fold. First <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eh0uqwgnVg\">the 16th Avenue Staircase is beautiful</a> &mdash; incredibly detailed and colorful. The mosaic staircase brings you on an intricate journey from sea-level scenes at the bottom then up through vibrant green scapes, all the way up to a moon at the top.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Second, the view! Once you&rsquo;re done, ahem, staring at the stairs and have climbed your way to the top &mdash; turn around! A beautiful view awaits!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">2. Seward Street Slides</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Cardboard is good for shipping stuff, building forts, and, in SF &hellip; speed! So bring some cardboard. It will make this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni-Pzt-YRHk\">urban slide adventure</a> more fun. The slides have been in the park for over 50 years and were designed by a local teenager.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">3. Magowan's Infinite Mirror Maze</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">First, get to Pier 39 and enjoy an incredible view of the bay. Then, once you&rsquo;re there, head to <a href=\"http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/magowans-infinite-mirror-maze\">Magowan's Infinite Mirror Maze</a> for an infinite view of yourself. You might have noticed a theme in our list so far &mdash; SF locals love to create cool experiences for residents and visitors alike. This is a city of sharing, expression, and community. Magowan's is no different. It was founded by local software developer, Charles Magowan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">4. The Wave Organ</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This incredible installation has been around for more than thirty years. <a href=\"https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/wave-organ\">The Wave Organ</a> is part of the <a href=\"https://www.exploratorium.edu/\">Exploratorium</a> at Pier 15. Located on a jetty in SF Bay, it&rsquo;s one of the city&rsquo;s most unique and unknown attractions. 25 organ pipes are at various points throughout the day by the tide and waves. It&rsquo;s a great place for quiet reflection as you sit and gaze at the water. Expect peace, beauty, and a one-of-a-kind ambiance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1502264126594\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/large_yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/medium_yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/small_yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/xsmall_yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_6099/media/2017-08-09-033452/thumb_yoda-statue-presidio-park-san-francisco.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">5. Yoda at Presidio National Park</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ok, you may have known LucasFilm is here, but did you know about the <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/v/yoda-fountain/4bdf4bdaffdec9286871eba1\">Yoda fountain</a>? The life-size Jedi statue stands just outside LucasFilm&rsquo;s lobby, which you can also visit to see Star Wars memorabilia including a life-size Darth Vader. Not a Star Wars fan? Well, go anyway &mdash; all of this is located in SF&rsquo;s famed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm\">Presidio National Park</a>, which has a ton to see and explore.</p>",
