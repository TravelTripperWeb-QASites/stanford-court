Watch the San Francisco Symphony play West Side Story along with the 1963 remastered film is projected. Both a movie night and night at the symphony all in one. <a href=\"https://www.sfsymphony.org/Buy-Tickets/2017-18/West-Side-Story.aspx\">Ticket info here.</a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Booking a stay in SF? <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/offers/\">Check&nbsp;out offers at our&nbsp;boutique hotel in Nob Hill.</a></em></p>",
