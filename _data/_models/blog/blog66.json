It fact, it&rsquo;s hard to find a restaurant that doesn&rsquo;t source local (and if they don&rsquo;t, do you really want to go there?) However, being the great restaurant city that San Francisco is, local restaurants have raised the bar on farm-to-table fare experimenting with different cuisines, different styles and different flavors. Here are some farm-to-table staples you should check out while in town:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Frances</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Comfortable, but still fancy, <a href=\"http://www.frances-sf.com/\">Frances</a> blurs the line between fine dining and comfort food. There&rsquo;s a simple elegance to each dish, in which the locally sourced and grown ingredients are the true stars of the show. Although the dishes do rotate, most days you should be able to snag some of the applewood smoked bacon beignets and the lumberjack cake. #ProTip: Get.On.That.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sons &amp; Daughters</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&rsquo;s a farm-2-table that&rsquo;s just a short walk from Stanford Court Hotel. Located on Bush Street, the dining experience at <a href=\"https://www.sonsanddaughterssf.com/\">Sons &amp; Daughters</a> is just as intimate as the setting. With a superb presentation, farm-fresh ingredients, and some of the most personable service in the entire Bay Area, Sons &amp; Daughters tasting menu is something to be tried. Just make sure to make a reservation beforehand, this restaurant only holds 28 seats.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nopa</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Nopa takes their food seriously - but seriously. Sourcing the freshest local ingredients isn&rsquo;t enough. They make everything from scratch - from the bread, to the cheese, to the smoked meats. <a href=\"http://nopasf.com/\">Nopa</a> does it all. Although the menu is diverse. It&rsquo;s also straightforward. Here you won&rsquo;t be scratching your head at the ingredient list, which is increasingly rare for a restaurant of this caliber. Here the burger is the crowd pleaser, but we also love the pork chop. It&rsquo;s outstanding. And enough to share - with the addition of a few small plates of course (pst - the warm goat cheese, hint hint, wink, wink).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">State Bird Provisions</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As the name suggests, the specialty at <a href=\"http://statebirdsf.com/\">State Bird Provisions</a> is quail. Served dim sum style, this crispy fried state bird is bursting with flavor. But don&rsquo;t just settle for the quail. Be adventurous. Accept the server&rsquo;s suggestions. Try different plates. At State Bird Provisions, you&rsquo;re guaranteed to discover something new, not just because of the kitchen&rsquo;s creativity, but because the menu is seasonal, which translates to the fact that you get the freshest, most delicious meals around.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</p>"
