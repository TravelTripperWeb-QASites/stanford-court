	"long_description": "<p><strong>February 2-16, 2017</strong><br /> <br /> The San Francisco Independent Film Festival, or <a href=\"http://sfindie.com/festivals/sf-indiefest/\" target=\"_blank\">SF Indie</a> for short, brings some of the most original, thought-provoking and diverse indie films from around the world to screens in the City by the Bay. Although independent, SF Indie has gained quite a large following in its 19 years, it&rsquo;s managed to keep it interesting and keep big sponsors out.<br /> <br /> While the indie films are always a big draw, SF Indie has also garnered a loyal, local following for the parties that come with the festival. In fact, several have earned a permanent spot on the Indie Fest party circuit, and in the hearts of San Francisco. Two in particular stand out: The Big Lebowski Party and the Anti-Valentine&rsquo;s Power Ballad Sing-Along.<br /> <br /> Fourteen years and counting, the festival&rsquo;s <strong>Big Lebowski</strong> game is strong. It&rsquo;s also tradition. Dress up as The Dude, down some white russians, and watch as Bawdy Caste performs the movie Live! On Stage! with the film playing in the background at the Brava Theater. You won&rsquo;t be the only one quoting along.<br /> <br /> For those of you that get a little bitter come February, there&rsquo;s the wildly popular <strong>Anti-Valentine&rsquo;s Day Power Ballad Sing-Along</strong>. Poison, Motley Crue, Whitesnake &ndash; all that 80s hair and makeup you want to forget, but can&rsquo;t &ndash; on the big screen. Dust off your zippos, you&rsquo;re about to sing your heart out. Art all, it&rsquo;s only appropriate that the indie fest would celebrate the commercial holiday with a rebel yell.<br /> <br /> There&rsquo;s also <strong>Mission B.A.G.</strong>, a self-proclaimed &ldquo;bad art show&rdquo; aimed at curating the worst (or best) art found at thrift stores, flea markets, and in the trash &ndash; further proving that art is all a matter of perspective. And like any good gallery opening, this one comes with complimentary beverages.<br /> <br /> There are still more parties, and a whole slew of films. To find the right one for you, see the SF Indie lineup here.<br /> <br /> ***<br /> <br /> Like what you&rsquo;re reading?
