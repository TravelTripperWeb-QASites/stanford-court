  "long_description": "<p>We all know the Bay Area is known for their oysters. The sight of delicious oysters over ice with a glass of champagne has our mouths watering. However, we know sometimes those platters can get a bit pricey so we&rsquo;ve narrowed our list down to some great happy hours that tame that seafood craving without breaking the bank. Not to mention, its one of the best ways to spend your time in the San Francisco. Here are the city&rsquo;s prime spots for $1 oysters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ferryplazaseafood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ferry Seafood Building</a>: This restaurant has only recently become known for their fantastic seafood including their oysters. They&rsquo;ve got an extremely extensive menu and a great variety of drinks. They have about 7 different oysters from across the US, including Kumamotos. It&rsquo;s a great place to grab some seafood and it completely allows you to avoid the touristy Fisherman&rsquo;s Warf. Also, note their happy hour: Tuesday-Saturday from 3:30 to 5:30. This includes $1 oysters, $4 Clam Chowder Cups and $3 Pomme Frites and more!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waterbarsf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Waterbar</a>: Waterbar is known for their great seafood and the view!

Stop by from noon to 6pm, Monday to Friday for $1.50 oysters ($2 on the weekend)! Also, we highly suggest you try the Cioppino.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hogandrocks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hog &amp; Rocks</a>: Now here&rsquo;s a place that has a unique concept.

It&rsquo;s located in the heart of Union Square and you&rsquo;ll really appreciate the decor. It&rsquo;s like an underwater fantasy! Their happy hour is from 4:30pm to 7pm daily to get a half dozen Drakes Bay oysters for only $6 bucks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-STAN</p>",
