  "long_description": "<p>Normally, the only way to get your workout on a vacation or business trip would be heading to your hotel gym. While I am proud to say our gym is full of great amenities including free yoga mats for use, it can sometimes just not be enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br /> The best workouts push you, get you outside, and try new things. Not to mention, traveling and keeping up with your workout routine truly go together. Whether, it&rsquo;s your fitbit or fitness tracker reminding you to keep up with your goals. I take pride in the fact that our hotel goes above usual fitness standards for our guests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br /> We offer bike rentals, helmets, yoga mats, bike and running routes from the hotel. We also work closely with San Francisco&rsquo;s Recreation and Park Department to provide you weekly FREE workout sessions throughout our parks. For example, this month you can join a variety of zumba and yoga classes that are extremely close to your hotel!
