  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Outside Lands is a SF tradition. From the August fog rolling in over Golden Gate Park to Ranger Dave, the eco-friendly MC, this music festival is pure San Francisco. And then there&rsquo;s its affinity for bringing great acts to the stage. From unknowns and up-and-comers to rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll legends, <a href=\"https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/\">Outside Lands</a> lineup is always a good one. And if you need any coercing, here are 5 reasons why you should be at Outside Lands this year, according 2 SCH:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">1. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s Outside Lands 10-Year Anniversary</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that Outside Lands is already 10-years-old. We&rsquo;ve danced like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow, sang our hearts out, and even crowd-surfed to acts like Radiohead, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Wonder, Elton John and The Foo Fighters during festivals past. That said, we&rsquo;re expecting none other than greatness for Outside Lands 10th birthday celebration. And hopefully Ranger Dave will have some surprises up his sleeve.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">2. The Lineup</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This year&rsquo;s lineup has something for everyone. From classic artists like The Who and Metallica, and the iconic sounds of the Gorillaz and A Tribe Called Quest, to the indie favorites Bomba Est&eacute;reo and Foxygen, here you&rsquo;ll be singing and dancing the entire time, as is #OutsideLands SOP.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">3. The Food</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Outside Lands set the standard for good festival food back when it started 10 years ago. Here, the food is just as important as the music (much like SF itself). At the festival you can munch on some of the city&rsquo;s best food trucks in Se&ntilde;or Sisig and Del Popolo, or dine with longtime Outside Lands restaurant partners Big Chef Tom&rsquo;s Belly Burgers, Alicia&rsquo;s Tamales Los Mayas, and tons more. And then you can revel in Choco Lands for dessert. Trust us - the food lineup just gets better each year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">4. The Barbary</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Outside Lands isn&rsquo;t all music. It&rsquo;s also some #seriously good standup. In fact, its comedy line-up is always just as impressive as its music. And although the 2017 line-up hasn&rsquo;t been released, past acts have included Fred Armisen, Maria Bamford, and Anthony Jeselnik. So this year, ya, we&rsquo;re expecting to be WOWed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">5. Outside Lands Supports the Environment</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Not only does Outside Lands offer tons of sustainable options - like a zero-waste setup, biodiesel generators, and a bike valet, it also has an on-site farmers market, an eco-village with composting workshops, and a refillable water program. Talk about feel good vibes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">6. SCH is Giving U a Mega Discount.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We want U 2 have fun. That&rsquo;s why Stanford Court Hotel is taking 20% off the price of our hotel rooms in honor of Outside Lands. As part of our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#outside-lands-save-20percent\">Outside Lands package</a>, we also give you a free water bottle, perfect for using and refilling at the festival. Sounds good doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Outside Lands 2017 is happening August 11-13 @ Golden Gate Park.
