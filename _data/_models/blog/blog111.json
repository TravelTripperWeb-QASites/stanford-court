  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A honeymoon is a time to be transported, to escape and enjoy each other. It&rsquo;s a time for new adventures as you begin your big adventure as a married couple. And Nob Hill is a great place to start that journey. You&rsquo;ll establish memories to cherish for the rest of your lives. To honeymoon in the Nob Hill neighborhood is to be transported together to a place of history, beauty, and style.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Surrounded by incredible views, opulent estates, and incredible food, you&rsquo;ll find it difficult not to feel romance in the air.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The incredible views come from Nob Hill&rsquo;s unique position in San Francisco. The southern face of the hill has an especially steep grade. So steep, in fact, it&rsquo;s the reason the cable car line was originally installed on the hill back in 1878 (the hill was too hard on the residents&rsquo; horses).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">That same cable car line is still in operation today. For your honeymoon, it offers a romantic way to glide into the city with your new love.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">All this to say, Nob Hill is an ideal home base for your San Francisco honeymoon. To give you a taste of the other delights San Francisco has to offer you and your special someone, here&rsquo;s a little sample &mdash; five perfect ways to celebrate your honeymoon in San Francisco.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Picnic with the Painted Ladies</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A simple picnic with one of the most iconic sights in San Francisco &mdash; it&rsquo;s the perfect way to begin your honeymoon.
