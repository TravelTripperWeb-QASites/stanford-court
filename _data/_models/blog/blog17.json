  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you want to know what a 20-year urban renaissance looks like? All you have to do is take a stroll in Chelsea, New York, to see it for yourself. Here at the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/blog/look-closer-the-beauty-of-the-high-line-is-in-its-details/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a>, we always recommend a trip to this eclectic neighborhood to visit the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/blog/look-closer-the-beauty-of-the-high-line-is-in-its-details/\">High Line</a>, Chelsea Market and much more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to overdose in inspiring and innovating art that&rsquo;s different from the typical collection you&rsquo;ll find at The MET, the Guggenheim or the MOMA, set an afternoon aside to walk around Chelsea at your leisure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just think about it. Over twenty years ago Chelsea was known for its docks, warehouses, dirty concrete buildings, cheap rent, but also for being a hub of up-and-coming art and creativity. Take <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/blog/a-pilgrimage-of-new-york-literary-sites/\">Hotel Chelsea</a>, for example&mdash;legendary writers, artists and musicians played a role in building the hotel&rsquo;s rich history. Today, Chelsea is known worldwide for its riveting contemporary art scene, but not everyone is aware that most of these galleries once were nondescript warehouses. Talk about an upgrade!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1523511395469\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" width=\"767\" height=\"512\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/large_royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/medium_royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/small_royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/xsmall_royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14541/media/2018-04-12-013633/thumb_royalton-chelsea-art-galleries-new-york.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The area between 10th and 11th Avenues and 18th to 28th Streets is home to clusters of galleries of everything from painting, to mixed media and sculpture. Visit <a href=\"http://www.chelseagallerymap.com/\">Chelsea Gallery Map</a> to read the latest news about current exhibits. You can also download a comprehensive and updated map of galleries open to the public. But here&rsquo;s the best news: the galleries are free! Instead of steep museum admission prices, soak in the talent of world-famous masters or check out the newbies that are being groomed for success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t forget to visit a nearby caf&eacute; to ponder on what you&rsquo;ve seen or even to start making your own sketch (sure, you can call that squiggle abstract art).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But before you can increase your artistic IQ by a hundredfold, you need a place to stay in New York. Why not choose the Royalton New York Hotel? Our <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/rooms-and-suites/\">luxurious rooms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/about/\">iconic lobby</a> and in-house<a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/eat-and-drink/\"> Bar 44</a> will top off your perfect day in Chelsea.</p>",
