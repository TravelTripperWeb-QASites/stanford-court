Taking a meeting outside the office not only levels the playing field, but also gives you a much needed mental break from emails, phone calls and constant interruptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next time you&rsquo;re planning to host a lunch meeting, make your reservation at<strong> <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/eat-and-drink/\">Forty Four Restaurant in Royalton New York Hotel</a> t</strong>o taste our brand new <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/blog/forty-four-brings-power-lunches-back-to-midtown/\">Power Lunch Menu</a>.</strong> With an intimate atmosphere, business lunches flow smoothly and our service is prompt to give you plenty of time to eat and discuss how to rule the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on our expertise attending to corporate clients, we wish to share our pointers on how to have a productive Manhattanite Power Lunch in 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Establish a Clear Purpose for the Meeting &nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re meeting with potential colleagues or that-hard-to-get client, as you invite them to join you for lunch, <strong>be clear on the objective of the meeting and what results you want from it.</strong> This way, all participants will know what to expect and you won&rsquo;t catch anyone off-guard.</p>\n<p>Remember that heading out with a specific purpose in mind will give you confidence and show your leadership skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Prepare an Agenda</h4>\n<p>Put together <strong>an outline of the topics</strong> that will be discussed to stay on topic. Although handouts are a good option in a conference room, they are impractical during a meal. Avoid the embarrassment of spilling sauce on a handout!</p>\n<p>Sending the agenda in advance will also help you to avoid drifting off-topic and manage time effectively. And speaking of time management...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Run Like a Swiss Watch</h4>\n<p>Be the boss. <strong>Arrive early, start on time and finish on time. </strong>Most of us don&rsquo;t have more than an hour or so for lunch and respecting your client or colleagues&rsquo; time will speak highly of you.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/contact/\">Contact Royalton New York to make a reservation at Forty Four</a></strong> and ensure that your table is ready for you when you arrive. If you&rsquo;re planning on a 45-minute lunch, try to <strong>limit the actual meeting to 20-30 minutes. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Show How Much You Care</h4>\n<p>Any communications expert will insist that body language matters. Silence your phone and don&rsquo;t lay it on the table to <strong>avoid unnecessary distractions. </strong></p>\n<p>Making eye contact and listening attentively will show your client or colleagues that you&rsquo;re interested in forming a real bond. <strong>Business culture revolves around a table.</strong> Part of sharing a meal involves relaxing a little and getting to know each other outside a <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/meetings-and-events/\">formal sit-down meeting. </a></strong></p>\n<p>And you may not want to admit it, but your parents were right: <strong>table manners matter</strong>, otherwise you&rsquo;ll risk distracting the participants with that piece of food rolling around in your mouth. No.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve had a taste of the good life at the Royalton, you&rsquo;ll want to come back for more. Apart from serving the corporate lunch crowd, the<strong> <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/meetings-and-events/penthouse-south/\">Royalton New York offers penthouses ideal for private meetings</a> or <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/meetings-and-events/social-events/\">venues available for private events</a>.</strong> Contact us to request a proposal or ask about our <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/offers/\">offers</a>. &nbsp;</strong></p>",
