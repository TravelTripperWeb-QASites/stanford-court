  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">June is prime festival month in the City by the Bay. From live music to delectable eats, there&rsquo;s something going on every weekend. Here are our picks for the top festivals in SF in June:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">SF Jazz Festival, June 6-18, 2017</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In its 35th year running, the <a href=\"https://sfjazz.org/\">SF Jazz Festival</a> is one of those iconic summer festivals that you can&rsquo;t miss. With over 40 different shows at various venues in the Hayes Valley neighborhood, there&rsquo;s little excuse to not make it out, especially when it&rsquo;s just 20 minutes away from Stanford Court Hotel via the cable car and BART. Performances range from tributes to Otis Redding and jazz legends Count Basie and Duke Ellington, as well as live shows by Herb Alpert and Stanley Clarke. Consult the <a href=\"https://sfjazz.org/events-calendar\">full schedule here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">North Beach Festival, June 18-19, 2017</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Known as SF&rsquo;s original street fair, <a href=\"http://www.sresproductions.com/events/north-beach-festival/\">North Beach Festival</a> is an excellent opportunity to tourist through this historic neighborhood. As part of the festival, there will be live music on two separate stages, hundreds of arts and crafts booths, primo festival food, and easily the most interesting part of the entire festival - Italian street painting. There&rsquo;s also a mass blessing of the animals at the shrine of St. Francis of Assisi. Take the Mason-Powell line from the hotel and you&rsquo;ll be there in 15 minutes without having to hike the hills.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stern Grove Festival, June 25-August 27, 2017</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This <a href=\"http://www.sterngrove.org/\">weekly outdoor concert series</a> never disappoints. Held in Sigmund Stern Grove, this huge (and free) summer concert happens every Sunday starting at the end of June and running through the end of August. This year&rsquo;s lineup includes names like Kool &amp; The Gang, Los &Aacute;ngeles Azules, Amadou &amp; Mariam, The Brazilian Girls, and as well as performances by the San Francisco Ballet and the San Francisco Symphony. It&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity for a picnic in this gorgeous park.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">SF Pride, June 24-25, 2017</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Pride isn&rsquo;t something we take lightly in SF. We go all out. <a href=\"http://www.sfpride.org/\">SF Pride</a> is the largest gay pride festival in the country. With over 20 stages, 300 different exhibitors, and 200 parade participants, the Civic Center Plaza fills to the brim year after year. A word of advice, don&rsquo;t even think about driving. Uber or Lyft it, or even better, take BART from the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>"
