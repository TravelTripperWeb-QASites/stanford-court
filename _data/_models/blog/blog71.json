  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So here at SCH we&rsquo;re huge fans of the <a href=\"https://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/farmers-market/\">Ferry Building Farmers Market</a> - the gorgeous produce, the delicious food, and the local producers. It&rsquo;s everything our SF foodie hearts want. That said, there&rsquo;s a way to go to the Ferry Building Farmers Market that makes it even more uh-maz-ing (aside from the fact that SCH is within walking distance) Consider this your insider guide to the Ferry Building, str8 from the mouths of us SF locals:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>#LocalTip 1 - Go Early.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Just like anything and everything good in San Francisco, the Ferry Building gets packed. We&rsquo;re talking inside, outside, and the parking. So if you want to enjoy your farmers market experience in peace, wake up and get moving. And if you can avoid it, don&rsquo;t drive. That is unless you plan on stocking up on local produce for dayz. In that case, we&rsquo;ll let it slide.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>#LocalTip 2 - Bring Your Own Bags + Bring Cash</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&rsquo;t expect to be getting any bags from the Ferry Market - or if you do, expect to pay. #ICYMI plastic bags are banned in San Francisco. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s just better if you bring your own bags with you from the start. While you&rsquo;re at it, bring a nice stack of cash too. This is SF, but that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that every stand in the farmers market takes cards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>#LocalTip 3 - Watch the Boats on the Bay</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Not only is the Ferry Building located along the Embarcadero, it&rsquo;s also surrounded by a bunch of green space. Once the crowds start to swarm, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to pull out a blanket and find your own spot on the grass around the Ferry Building. Here you get gorgeous views of the bay and the boats passing through. This is #thespot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>#LocalTip 4 - Skip Across to Sausalito</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Being at the Ferry Building gives you the perfect excuse to hop the ferry to Sausalito. That&rsquo;s where the ferry departs! (get it? &ldquo;Ferry Building&rdquo;) So, what excuse do you have 2 not go? Go crazy. Live a little. And spend the rest of your day at that lovely little stretch of land in Marin County.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We&rsquo;re neighbors! The Ferry Building Farmers Market is just a downhill stroll from <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">Stanford Court Hotel</a>. That said, make sure to stop by during your stay with us at SCH. The Ferry Building Farmers Market is open Monday-Friday from 10am &ndash; 7pm, Saturday from 8am &ndash; 6pm, and Sunday from 11am &ndash; 5pm.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>",
