  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether it is your first, fifth or fifteenth time to San Francisco, there is always something new to explore. With the perfect blend of classic and modern, San Francisco offers something for everyone. While our hotel is in the historic Nob Hill district, I like to get out and explore all of the neighborhoods and sights. Each neighborhood has a unique vibe and community that contribute to the collective energy of the city by the bay.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some of my must-see spots for when you visit San Francisco:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Palace of Fine Arts:</strong> Originally built in 1915 for the Panama- Pacific Exposition, the grandeur and beauty of the structure remains a classic icon on the San Francisco landscape. Bring your camera for photos of the massive pillars, gorgeous architecture, and pond. Early mornings promise a peaceful moment and you can expect photographers from around the world shooting the Palace all day. It&rsquo;s a popular destination for engagement and wedding photos.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Haight Street:</strong> Haight Ashbury was the epicenter of the hippy culture and it could be said, still is. Locals in that time included the Grateful Dead at 710 Ashbury, Janis Joplin at 122 Lyon Street and Jefferson Airplane at 2400 Fulton. I like coming here to check out the shops and always visit Amoeba Records and Magnolia Pub and Brewery.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Golden Gate Aquarium at California Academy of Sciences:</strong> Whether you are interested in science or not, you must pay a visit to the Aquarium at the <a title=\"Academy of Sciences\" href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Academy of Sciences</a>. It&rsquo;s perfect for all ages and you will feel like a mermaid and merman as you sit there and watch fishes, sharks, and sea creatures swim by.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Valencia Street:</strong> The Mission District has quickly become one of the most popular neighborhoods in San Francisco for great eats and nightlife. Valencia Street has great restaurants, bars, and shops from 14th Street all the way to 26th Street. I suggest taking a stroll up and down both sides of the street before settling on where to eat.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">These are a few of my recommendations!
