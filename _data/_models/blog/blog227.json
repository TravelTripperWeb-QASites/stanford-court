To keep up with SF&rsquo;s fast pace, Stanford Court continuously explores the creative minds that are leaving a mark on the city. This time, we worked alongside <a href=\"https://www.brianbarneclo.com/\">artist Brian Barneclo</a> who painted our latest mural in our West Arcade entrance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yKZDIVPWY5Q7lTmW0AVQAFJWoJNXtP39Mhw16sCrqtHvndfoEq6MlQ_cYgjpcjI1TYdJfC9oV8-mA-szmhrRxXFDEsO0idRFUT19G_Or79nRWb5rqbfPB1NtBrDqE1MIZvdBQman\" width=\"624\" height=\"452\" /></p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">About Stanford Court&rsquo;s Newest Mural</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During your stay at Stanford Court or next time you stop for a <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/dining/\">drink at Seven Stills</a>, take some time to check out Brian&rsquo;s creation. Titled &ldquo;Straight Up,&rdquo; the mural is strategically located across from Cannon Dill&rsquo;s monochromatic mural, &ldquo;Spirit Wolf,&rdquo; to offer a stunning contrast that speaks about the city&rsquo;s many facets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Straight Up&rdquo; is an intricate combination of blue and orange hues that was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/neighborhood/\">Nob Hill</a> itself. You&rsquo;ll notice iconic sights, such as a cable car riding up a hill, Bay Bridge, Chinatown and Starlight Room Star, a reminder of how close our hotel is to everything of importance in SF.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ymOpAlHY191-v5JFdMvftV_gSawrp-erXuFVP7eat1FXzFxrd9tGtsQR_ctujVxMaoVT_YCqBzcKkoYI9eY-E6WXueu0Qvojz58DwY9ND95xv5iNCtqaToFtsO-2NBZQTS70NEkS\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\" /></p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Brian Barneclo&rsquo;s Murals Around SF</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to see more work from this artist, you are in the right city. Brian painted San Francisco&rsquo;s largest mural to date, &ldquo;Systems&rdquo; a 600&rsquo; x 40&rsquo; painting near Caltrain station in Mission Bay. Whether you&rsquo;re commuting, driving or walking, you can easily see the panoramic mural from Townsend Street and 7th Street.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not far from that SF landmark is the 225&rsquo; x 25&rsquo; mural at Foodsco, located at Shotwell Street between 14th and 15th Streets, and the <a href=\"https://stfrancisfountainsf.com/\">St. Francis Fountain</a> mural at the corner of York Street and 24th Street. While you&rsquo;re there, why not grab an icy treat at <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/search/?query=ice%20cream&amp;button=\">SF&rsquo;s oldest ice cream parlor</a>? If you&rsquo;re in the mood for some Northern California cuisine, head instead to <a href=\"http://nopasf.com/gallery/\">Nopa restaurant</a> at 560 Divisadero Street. You&rsquo;ll be served wood-fired dishes prepared with seasonal ingredients while Brian&rsquo;s work will greet you at every corner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have we piqued your interest?
