  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Spring is in the air and the bats will soon be swinging at <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AT&amp;T Park</a> as the Giants celebrate their 60th season in San Francisco. <strong>April 3rd is opening day at the park</strong>, where the Giants will take to the field against the Seattle Mariners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you&rsquo;re staying with us, AT&amp;T Park is just a mile and a half south of Stanford Court Hotel, and it&rsquo;s a beauty, with a classic design and incredible views of San Francisco Bay.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">On opening day, the first 40,000 fans will receive an Opening Day Calendar. Other promotions this season include:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Saturday, April 7th vs. the Dodgers<br /></strong>The first 35,000 people to enter the ballpark will get a 60th anniversary Willie Mays bobblehead!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Sunday, June 3rd vs. Philadelphia Phillies</strong>&nbsp;<br />The first 35,000 fans will get a 60th-anniversary bobblehead of Willie &ldquo;Stretch.&rdquo; McCovey.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Saturday, August 25th vs. the Rangers</strong>&nbsp;<br />If you&rsquo;re one of the first 35,000 fans to enter the ballpark you&rsquo;ll get a Buster Hugs bobblehead.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Sunday, September 2nd vs. the New York Mets</strong>&nbsp;<br />The first 20,000 fans will get Buster Posey socks!</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Celebrating 60 Years in SF</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Like we said, this is the Giants&rsquo; 60th year in San Francisco, so this season is special. The team will be wearing a commemorative 60th-anniversary patch throughout the season. They&rsquo;ll also be retiring controversial slugger Barry Bonds&rsquo; number on August 11th when they play the Pirates. (In his seven seasons with the Pirates from 1986-92, Bonds hit .275 with 176 home runs, 556 RBIs, and a .883 OPS.) But it was with our very own San Francisco Giants that Bonds became a five-time MVP and an MLB record-holder with 762 home runs, 2,558 walks, and 688 intentional walks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\"No other Giants player has worn No. 25 since Barry's final season,\" Giants president and CEO Laurence M. Baer said. \"It's time to officially retire his number in honor of his remarkable 22-year career as one of the greatest players of all time and for his countless achievements and contributions as a Giant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Whether you&rsquo;re an avid baseball fan or just looking for a great time in the city, a Giants game is a great and classic way to spend a spring afternoon in SF.</p>",
