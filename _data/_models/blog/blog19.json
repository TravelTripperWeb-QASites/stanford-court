  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Our jobs advance our careers, pay the bills and give us very expensive medical bills in the long run. Not all of us are lucky to be in those hip offices where you meditate next to your boss or who organize daily exercise routines. Not to worry, though! If you work in the corporate area around the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a>, we have some suggestions on how to get fit, spend more time outside and give your body a break from sedentarism.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1524198298652\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" alt=\"royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym\" width=\"769\" height=\"513\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/large_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/medium_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/small_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/xsmall_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002327/thumb_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-gym.jpg\" /></h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Join a Gym or REC Center</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Exercising to counteract the long hours in the office is a no-brainer. New York has infinite possibilities, from the high-end and exclusive gyms, to the simple and affordable. Our suggestion is to sign up for a membership in a gym close to your office&mdash;that way, you&rsquo;ll get into the habit of working out right before or after work. <br /><br />If you work close to the Royalton in Midtown, <strong>24 Hour Fitness</strong> has two locations: Midtown Ultra Sport at 153 E 53rd St. and Madison Square Park Ultra Sport at 225 Fifth Avenue. Apart from their classes, these gyms are open, well, 24 hours a day! <br /><br /><strong>Chelsea Piers</strong> is also a great option if you want a different activity to break the routine. Check out their <a href=\"https://www.chelseapiers.com/also/drop-in/\">Drop-In Activities</a> and try something new. You might find a new hobby along the way. <br /><br />Last but not least, <strong><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/befitnyc/recreation/in/10036/\">Recreation Centers</a></strong> by the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation offer good facilities, classes and sports at affordable prices in various locations across New York City.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1524198379467\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" alt=\"royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors\" width=\"764\" height=\"509\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/large_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/medium_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/small_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/xsmall_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14833/media/2018-04-20-002613/thumb_royalton-staying-fit-new-york-workout-outdoors.jpg\" /></h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Take it Outside</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As much as you love strength training or indoor classes, it&rsquo;s good to change things up a bit. Or you may not be interested, at all, in being inside after being in an office all day. Regardless of your preferences, take your workout outside. Running, power-walking or simply walking are excellent choices for beginners or those wanting to keep costs down&mdash;all you need is a good pair of running shoes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your commute goes past any of these routes, consider replacing your time stuck in the rush-hour craze and run, jog or walk part of your commute.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/running-track.html\">Central Park Reservoir</a></strong> is a beautiful <strong>1.58-mile </strong>route that takes you through the heart of Central Park and the renovated running track. If you want a longer loop, check out the <strong>Central Park Loop</strong>, a <strong>6.02-mile</strong> route that takes you across the entire park.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are an experienced runner or cyclist, try the <strong><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/local/us/new-york-city/running/routes/158\">Hudson River Greenway route</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s<strong> 15.9 miles</strong> from Fort Washington Park to Chelsea Waterside Park and you&rsquo;ll see stunning views of Hudson River. <br /><br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just as it&rsquo;s important to keep your body healthy, it&rsquo;s essential to keep your mind healthy as well. Why not treat yourself to a couple of drinks at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/eat-and-drink/\">Bar 44</a> after work to unwind? Or better yet, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/offers/\">offers</a> and book a relaxing weekend at the iconic Royalton Hotel.</p>",
