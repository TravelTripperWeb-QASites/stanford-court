  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Masonic in SF is a mid-century concert hall located just &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/Stanford+Court+Hotel,+California+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA,+United+States/The+Masonic,+1111+California+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94108,+USA/@37.7916521,-122.4122782,18z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085808c561d773d:0xb7afe5bc9f50d89c!2m2!1d-122.4095981!2d37.7915052!1m5!1m1!1s0x808580929a546915:0xf0d9dedd95a89b5f!2m2!1d-122.413186!2d37.791287?hl=en\">three minutes </a>from Stanford Court. The venue has great acoustics and seating&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;there really isn&rsquo;t a bad seat in the house&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and they just happened to release their lineup of concerts and shows for this fall. Here we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of the acts we&rsquo;re most excited about (and you should be too).&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Kesha<br>Oct. 31</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">After a 5-year hiatus of wrenching legal battles against her former producer and record label boss, our dear K-Money is back. She&rsquo;ll be performing on Halloween night, which ought to be quite a colorful reunion for her and her faithful SF fans. Kesha will be performing songs from her new album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd5dcjXzuGk\">Rainbow</a>, released in August. Each pair of tickets comes with a physical copy of Kesha&rsquo;s new album, which has been hailed as a &ldquo;triumphant return&rdquo; from The Rolling Stone magazine. In case you haven&rsquo;t seen it, check out her title-track single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd5dcjXzuGk\">here</a>. We&rsquo;re thrilled she&rsquo;s back and coming to the Bay Area.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Seth Meyers <br /></strong>Nov. 17</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s been quite a year, so what better way to cure any ills with a night of laughter? SNL veteran and late-night host Seth Meyers is coming to the Bay Area. After 13 years on SNL, also working as a Weekend Update correspondent, Meyers has gone on to host <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers\">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a> on NBC. Meyers is usually busy in NYC taping weekly episodes for Late Night, so it&rsquo;s quite the treat he&rsquo;s visiting us over here on the west coast. Meyers is a Golden Globe and Emmy winner for his writing, so his stand-up should be no exception.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Trevor Noah<br /></strong>Nov. 20, 24 &amp; 25</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Trevor Noah is a comedian from South Africa who hit his stride in the last few years as host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central. In 2016, his autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood/dp/0399588175\">Born a Crime: Stories From a South African &nbsp;Childhood</a>, was published and immediately became a NY Times Best-Seller. Noah&rsquo;s background and perspective is distinctive because he was born to a black mother and white father during apartheid in South Africa. Famous for his wide array of accents and commentary on race and international politics, Noah will do a total of five shows at The Masonic, all expected to sell out. In case you can&rsquo;t make it to his stand-up this fall, Netflix is slated to release his ninth comedy special early next year, &ldquo;Afraid of the Dark.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Niall Horan</strong><br />Novs. 22</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Niall Horan released his debut solo album this last year after years performing international sold-out shows with One Direction. Now, Horan is trying his own hand in the music world. His hit &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBmNcLBaPUE\">Slow Hands</a>,&rdquo; was received warmly by critics and fans. SF is one of few stops for Horan on his global tour, which includes Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and his hometown of of Dublin.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>GLIDE Annual Holiday Jam</strong><br />Nov. 29&nbsp;</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">This is a good one for the holidays. GLIDE has deep roots in the Bay Area community, providing meals for the hungry as early as the 1960s. GLIDE is focused on creating a &ldquo;radically inclusive, just and loving community mobilized to alleviate suffering and break the cycles of poverty and marginalization.&rdquo; Grammy award-winning singer Valerie Simpson is set to perform, and the evening will have food and drink provided by some Bay Area local restaurants. &nbsp;All money raised from the event goes to GLIDE&rsquo;s Daily Free Meals program and other services. The evening will be filled with love and goodwill, perfect for the holidays.<br /><br />--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Ready to book?
