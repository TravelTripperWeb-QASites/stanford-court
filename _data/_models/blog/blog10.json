Luckily, we&rsquo;ve a little secret to share with you that will completely change your winter in New York&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">The Royalton New York Hotel</a></strong> is not only an iconic and elegant hotel in the <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/location/\">heart of New York</a></strong>, we&rsquo;re also the only hotel in the five boroughs that has real, wood-burning fireplaces. As long as the temperature is in the low 40&deg;F or less, you&rsquo;ll be able to call the front desk and request to have your fireplace lit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But we also know you probably don&rsquo;t want to be hibernating in your room during your entire stay, so here are our top suggestions for making the most of the icy weather before heading back to your <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/rooms-and-suites/\">r<strong>oom at the Royalton New York</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1519691037332\" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"509\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/large_royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/medium_royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/small_royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/xsmall_royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12906/media/2018-02-26-192356/thumb_royalton-winter-central-park.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By far the best way to get warm is to get your blood pumping. A stroll in Central Park never gets old, regardless of how many times you&rsquo;ve come to New York. You might know your favorite pathways and the shortcuts to avoid the most crowded parts, but why not add a little bit of insider&rsquo;s knowledge to your repertoire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Central Park Conservancy</strong> offers <strong><a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/tours/?referrer=https://www.google.com/&amp;#guided_tours_tab\">official tours</a>,</strong> guided or self-guided. You can choose anything from Central Park&rsquo;s highlights, to its hidden gems, such as The North Woods and Hallett Nature Sanctuary. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While you&rsquo;re in that part of town, ice-skating is always an option - &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/\"><strong>Wollman Rink in Central Par</strong>k</a> is open until April 1st. Other options are the rink at <strong><a href=\"http://bryantpark.org/amenities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park\">Bryant Park</a></strong>, open until March 4, or <strong><a href=\"https://therinkatrockcenter.com/\">The Rink in Rockefeller Center</a></strong>, open until April 15. Now that the holiday season is over, you can take advantage of fewer crowds in Rockefeller Center and book exclusive ice-skating experiences. Some options include an afternoon tea &amp; skating package, apr&egrave;s skate (cocktails and nibbles) or starlight skate, which guarantees admission to the last skating session of the day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever you choose, end the day in your cozy room at the <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York</a></strong>, aka your sanctum sanctorum in New York.
