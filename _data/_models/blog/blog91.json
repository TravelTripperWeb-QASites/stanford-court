  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We don&rsquo;t just think Stanford Court is the best hotel to stay at in San Francisco - we know it. From our trendy, tech-savvy amenities to the most comfortable beds and the most #instagramworthy views of the Bay, Alcatraz and the Financial District, SCH is a dream come true in SF, all at a reasonable price. Because we know how rare that is to find, here are 10 reasons to stay at Stanford Court. #alltrue</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">1. We&rsquo;re high-tech.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">At SCH we&rsquo;re all about optimizing, digitizing, streamlining everything possible. From our i-pad check-in process to our &uuml;ber high-speed WiFi, SCH is all about the digital age. Here you can finish up that presentation in our fully equipped business center, complete with MacBooks, iPads, iPad minis, and wireless printing, or catch up on your reading with Foli on one of our in-house iPads or iPad minis, all part of our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/amenities/\">Urban Bundle package</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">2. We have Autobahn WiFi.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Our WiFi&rsquo;s so fast it deserves its own mention. Ever book a hotel with &ldquo;free WiFi&rdquo; only to find out it's #TheWorst ever? Probably all the time, right? At Stanford Court Hotel that doesn&rsquo;t happen. We take our WiFi VERY seriously, which is why we make sure our WiFi is lightning fast, aka Autobahn fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">3. You can bring your pet.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We don&rsquo;t like traveling without our four-legged companions - &nbsp;so we don&rsquo;t. And neither should you. We&rsquo;re one of the few SF hotels that let <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/amenities/pet-friendly/\">our guests bring their dogs</a> when they come visit. At SCH, we treat your pet like our own. Bring your pooch to SCH and they&rsquo;ll get a goodie bag, food &amp; water, and even their own bed. SCH is #petfriendly</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">4. We&rsquo;re located in the heart of Nob Hill</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Nob Hill is one of SF&rsquo;s most iconic neighborhoods. With its trademark hills and Victorian houses, Nob Hill still retains much of its historic San Francisco charm. After all, Nob Hill was where all the tycoons settled, including our namesake, Leland Stanford. ( #didyouknow - Stanford Court is built on the former site of Stanford&rsquo;s mansion?) And being in the heart of Nob Hill puts you steps or just a cable car ride away (or walk!) from the Embarcadero, Union Square, Grace Cathedral and Huntington Park.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">5. We&rsquo;re affordable!</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Try finding something reasonably priced in San Francisco, just try. And in Nob Hill, it&rsquo;s even more difficult. While some Nob Hill hotels can break the bank, Stanford Court&rsquo;s not about that. We believe in providing luxury accommodations and amenities and personalized service at a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">6. We&rsquo;re on the cable car lines</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Part of the fun of being in the heart of Nob Hill is that you can ride the cable cars around. And at SCH, all three lines pass right in front of the hotel - that&rsquo;s saying - &nbsp;the California line, the Powell-Mason line, and the Powell-Hyde line. Where will you go?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">7. THE VIEWS</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Did we mention we have gorgeous views? Maybe we did, but it needs to be mentioned again. We do have some of the best views in the City by the Bay. Being located on a hill and having huge windows makes for gorgeous views of the city and the bay. We can&rsquo;t get enough. Here you gaze out at the city #fordays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">8. We have a 24-hour fitness center</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Exercise is kinda <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/the-most-scenic-running-routes-in-sf/\">our thing</a>. Whether it&rsquo;s biking outdoors on our Martone bikes or hiking throughout California&rsquo;s numerous state and national parks, we&rsquo;re constantly getting that heart rate pumping. And when we&rsquo;re not outdoors, we&rsquo;re in Stanford Court&rsquo;s 24-hour fitness center because there&rsquo;s nothing like that early morning workout to start the day off right or that late-night run to shake off the stress.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">9. We&rsquo;re green.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">From complimentary refillable water bottles to Zipcar charging stations, we at SCH are committed to providing a hotel stay with the least carbon footprint possible. We even source all-local ingredients in our restaurant to ensure we are doing our part - and helping the community in the process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">10. We&rsquo;re not your typical Nob Hill hotel.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Although Nob Hill has had the historic reputation of harboring, ahem, snobs, SCH is nothing of the sort. In fact, we couldn&rsquo;t be further from that. We&rsquo;re down-to-earth, friendly, and eager to make your stay in San Francisco as memorable as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>"
