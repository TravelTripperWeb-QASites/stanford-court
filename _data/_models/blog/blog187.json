Governor and state senator; president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, tycoon, industrialist, robber baron, landowner, and one of the minds behind motion picture, Mr. Stanford is an example of a visionary risk taker who dared to dream big in a city that nurtures innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">As part of our nod to innovation, design, technology, and mavericks spirit in a city that&rsquo;s fertile for such growth, we want to recognize San Francisco innovators -- movers and shakers who take a chance on new ideas. Today, that person is SF native Margaret Cho.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Margaret Cho is a comedian, author, actress, fashion designer and jack of all trades who has paved the way for Asian Americans, queer folk, and outcasts since the 1990s.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Her 1995 sitcom, &ldquo;All-American Girl&rdquo; was unique for its time, focusing on a Korean-American family dealing with a broad range of issues that were relatable to all families living in America. Cho&rsquo;s representation of a rebellious Korean-American teenager that often battled her parent&rsquo;s traditions was unchartered territory in the world of &rsquo;90s sitcoms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">After dealing with personal problems caused by the show, Cho came back to the world of stand-up to explore such topics. While more commonplace today, it wasn&rsquo;t so often that comedians (especially female comedians) discuss such taboo subjects in their routines. Her 2000 standup routine, I&rsquo;m the One That I Want, has been praised by critics and comedians for taking risks and discussing subjects that remain off-limits and unmentionable for many.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Cho similarly navigated these subjects with clarity in her published works, discussing LGBT issues, global politics, and human rights with reckless abandon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Born and raised in San Francisco, Margaret Cho occasionally returns to perform stand-up. One of her favorite restaurants happens to be The Big 4 Restaurant in Nob Hill, right near Grace Cathedral. A NBC story on the comedian features her favorite restaurants in the area, from Korean food to breakfast joints. <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/the-scene/Margaret-Chos-SF-Food-Tour-122815609.html\">Read more here.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">After ventures in music, fashion, the sex toy industry, and belly dancing gear, Cho resides in Georgia and continues to do what she does best: ruffle feathers and address uncomfortable issues. The world has certainly changed since she stepped into the spotlight in the 1990s.
