  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When you visit a city you want to get immersed in it, right? Live like a local? Well, whether you&rsquo;re coming to San Francisco for two hours, two days or two weeks, we&rsquo;ve got the places you will want to check out. They are local favorites and usually kept close to the chest, but since we like you, we&rsquo;ll share.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco Zoo</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You probably won&rsquo;t find the San Francisco Zoo at the top of most lists for what to do in San Francisco, but locals treasure this favorite spot. It&rsquo;s quaint, it&rsquo;s charming, and when the weather is right there is no better place to be. Located on Sloat Blvd. and The Great Highway, locals love to explore the Zoo then head to Ocean Beach to watch the surfers catch some waves.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bernal Heights Park</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Locals love Bernal Heights Park because it&rsquo;s a quiet spot where you can get some fresh air and feel like you escaped the bustling city. A photographer&rsquo;s favorite, Bernal Hill provides hikers with a breathtaking 360-degree panorama and clear views of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, San Bruno Mountain, and the hills of the East Bay- yup, you can see them all even when it&rsquo;s fellow hill Twin Peaks is fogged in.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bimbo&rsquo;s 365 Club</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There is probably no other club as famous among locals than Bimbo&rsquo;s. Opened in 1931 and originally located on Market Street, Bimbo&rsquo;s was the destination for fun and festivities during the down times of the Depression. When Bimbo&rsquo;s moved to Columbus Avenue in North Beach in 1951, the scene got even more exciting. Today the club is still known for having the best music acts, private parties, and weddings. <a title=\"View their upcoming shows here\" href=\"http://www.bimbos365club.com/upcoming-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View their upcoming shows here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco Public Library</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">With 30 branches throughout the city, locals know how valuable our library system is. If you&rsquo;re visiting the city, we recommend visiting the Main Library Branch in the heart of the Civic Center. The library always has great free programming to residents, organizes an amazing &ldquo;<a title=\"One City, One Book\" href=\"https://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000995301\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One City, One Book</a>&rdquo; program, and offers free museum passes through their &ldquo;<a title=\"Discover &amp; Go\" href=\"https://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000812701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discover &amp; Go</a>&rdquo; program.&nbsp;</p>"
