San Francisco has a variety of ways to unwind from any crazy work week whether it&rsquo;s going on a hike, checking out a local brewery, or even meeting up with some colleagues at a coffee shop. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I&rsquo;m looking to unwind, there&rsquo;s generally food involved. Nothing is better than a food coma right?! Well, I&rsquo;ve found three places that are worth checking out and they aren&rsquo;t too far from the hotel! Whether you are here for business or pleasure, everyone deserves a great night out and a good meal.</p>\n<p><strong>Nook</strong>: This quaint eatery is a little bit of a walk from the hotel, but a worthwhile one. This cafe is located at the corner of Hyde Street and Jackson on Russian Hill. The staff members really make this place memorable and are sure to greet you with a smile. The menu features healthy options that never compromise on taste. Our pick: the turkey, melted brie and cranberry sauce sandwich accompanied by a refreshing glass of their homemade sangria. The Nook also gets our vote for ambience and is a great people watching spot, with its location right next to the cable car line.</p>\n<p><strong>Nob Hill Cafe</strong>: This spot is a real hidden gem. This restaurant is only minutes away from us and it&rsquo;s tucked away so keep an eye out for their sign. The chef does a wonderful job using seasonal food ingredients and it&rsquo;s a great place to tame those Italian food cravings. Sometimes there is a wait, but their cocktails are the perfect way to kill time. It&rsquo;s a great place to relax after a long work day and I can guarantee your belly will be a happy one after dining here. The carbonara, pizza, and gnocchi are must-haves here.</p>\n<p><strong>Aliment</strong>: &nbsp;Located on the corner of Bush and Mason, Aliment is a quick walk from the hotel! I am all about local ingredients and Aliment does not disappoint on this front. Their menu changes depending on the availability of ingredients, so be sure to savor those dishes you love because chances are, they won&rsquo;t be there for long. This place puts a unique twist on American dining so grab one of their unique beers on tap and don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment.</p>\n<p>Have you found something that I must try?
