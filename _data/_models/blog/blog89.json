It&rsquo;s name is derived from a Spanish word meaning &ldquo;small willow grove.&rdquo; If you enjoy the outdoors, from boardwalks and quiet trails to small parks and views of the bay, this place is a must-visit. #FunFact: Otis Redding wrote \"Dock of the Bay\" while staying on a houseboat at Waldo Point in Sausalito in 1967.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here are some tips that will help you plan your own day trip 2 Sausalito.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Getting there</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s only 10 miles but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to drive.
