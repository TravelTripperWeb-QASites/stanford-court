At our Nob Hill hotel, we are proud to offer eco-friendly amenities without compromising service and convenience. While we are always pleased to share our green approach, we are especially excited to celebrate April as Earth Month and provide our guests with great offerings, such as an Earth Day special.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">April is full of great events and activities in celebration of our beautiful earth! We hope you will enjoy our Eco-Map that shares all of our favorite eco-friendly businesses in San Francisco. We are anticipating the San Francisco Green Film Festival April 14-20 (<a href=\"http://prod3.agileticketing.net/websales/pages/list.aspx?epguid=43e9ba24-eaf0-49ac-8738-683d2fc3af46&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">you can see the schedule here</a>), where filmmakers from around the world will be sharing 100&rsquo;s of compelling and relevant environmental film programs. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <a href=\"http://www.greenfilmfest.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">Green Film Festival website</a>, &ldquo;Filmmakers have all provided a participatory space for the eco-savvy and green curious to meet filmmakers, environmental experts and campaigners, to watch, discuss and create ideas for a better world.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also don&rsquo;t want to miss the new art installation </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intrude</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Australian artist, Amanda Parer. The five 23-foot tall rabbits are located in front of City Hall through April 25. While they seem playful, the real message is saddening. Parer&rsquo;s intention is to call attention to how the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact we have on the environment is often overlooked.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also recommend getting outdoors and exploring San Francisco on foot or by bike. Have you checked out our Bike the Bridge package? It provides guests with an easy way to enjoy the Golden Gate Bridge, see the city, and get some exercise.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope you will join us and the San Francisco community in supporting green initiatives, while simultaneously building community.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for reading our blog!
