Whether you are looking to capture that image that will increase your instagram game or just looking to get your heart rate up, here are 5 hikes that are worth the climb:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stow Lake &amp; Strawberry Hill in Golden Gate Park:</strong></p>\n<p>The infamous Strawberry Hill takes up an entire island in the center of Stow Lake. Just shy of 500 feet, this marks the highest point in the park and the best views! The hike to the hill is a little more than 2 miles and from the summit you can get some pretty spectacular views of Downtown, Golden Gate, and the Marin. Also, FYI there are no strawberries, so that&rsquo;s a bit of a misnomer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Davis-Steep Ravine Loop:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a popular hike and it&rsquo;s recommend that you depart from Stinson Beach. The loop is about 7 miles so be prepared to leave early in the morning! This hike is full of redwood, oak forests, waterfalls, canyons, and great views! It will showcase views of Stinson beach, the coastline, and Point Reyes!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Tamalpais:</strong></p>\n<p>Head north of the Golden Gate Bridge and you will see the gorgeous Mount Tamalpais. It&rsquo;s full of redwood groves and oak woodlands with pretty amazing views from the foot peak. If you can go on a clear day, you will be able to see the Farallon Islands, the Marin County, Bay, San Francisco, and Mount Diablo, so check the weather before you head out for this one!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Twin Peaks:</strong></p>\n<p>This is an iconic San Francisco hike for good reason. Boasting the highest point in San Francisco, the summit offers 360 degree views of the city.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve:</strong></p>\n<p>Typically people visit the Russian Ridge during springtime with the hope of seeing blooming wildflowers. However, even if you miss the wildflowers, this hike does not disappoint. This 3.5 mile hike takes you right up to the top of this 2600 foot hill which features views of the ocean to the west and hills (including Mount Diablo) to the east.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Photography: Rolando Rodriguez</p>",
