	"long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">For as connected as SF always is, it&rsquo;s also can be just as unplugged. That&rsquo;s because although San Francisco is THE techie city in the United States, it&rsquo;s also filled with numerous outdoor areas and natural wonders. That said, even if you are coming to SF for work, also take some time to unplug. Your mind, body, and soul will thank you 4 it. This is the SCH Guide 2 Unplugging.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Visit Huntington Park</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You don&rsquo;t have to venture far from SCH to get in touch with SF&rsquo;s beauty. There are plenty of places in the neighborhood, aka <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/stanford-court-guide-2-nob-hill/\">Nob Hill</a>, where you can #unplug in the heart of the city. Take Huntington Park, for example. It&rsquo;s a block away from SCH and one of the most beautiful parks in the city. Here you have green spaces, sculptures, views of Grace Cathedral, and plenty of benches. Come here 2 relax and take a break.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Go #OffTheGrid like a local</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So, those of us that live in San Francisco tend to be nature junkies. We can&rsquo;t help it. SF and the surrounding area is out-of- this-world gorgeous. And you don&rsquo;t even have to travel far to get #OutThere. In SF, you can be transported to spectacular cliffs, green hills and crashing waves, all less than an hour from SCH.

Literally unplug and let go at SCH.
