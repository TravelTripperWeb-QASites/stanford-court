  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When you stay with us you get access to borrow our bikes and cruise the city streets. There are so many places to explore by bike that we wanted to share the bike trails we love. So grab your bike from the concierge, strap on your helmet and let&rsquo;s go!</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Beginner:</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Embarcadero</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Head to the Embarcadero for one of the smoothest and flattest rides in all of San Francisco. You can wind around AT&amp;T Ballpark, head to Pier 39, and if you want, continue along to Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf and Aquatic Park. We love it because it&rsquo;s scenic, easy to hit up tourist attractions, and you can ride on the sidewalk instead of navigating the cars. The hardest part of this route is probably just sharing the sidewalk with pedestrians.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Intermediate:</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Golden Gate Bridge</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There is nothing more iconic than riding one of our bikes across the famous #GGB. But with many advanced cyclists crossing the bridge on their route from the Presidio to Marin, it&rsquo;s not advised for first time riders. You&rsquo;ll need to be adept at sharing the road with skilled bikers, maintaining a good pace, and be able to ride the 3.2 mile distance of the bridge, incline and all. It&rsquo;s one of our favorites for its beauty and picturesque view of the city skyline.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Advanced:</h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Presidio to Ocean Beach</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This route is suggested for advanced riders because of the distance and steep inclines. Heading to the Presidio allows riders to feel like they have escaped city life. Endless switchbacks, challenging inclines, and gorgeous scenery, the Presidio trails are not to be missed. <a title=\"See all of the routes here\" href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/transportation-internal/Shared%20Documents/Presidio%20Bike%20Map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See all of the routes here</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Wherever you head, just be sure you grab one of our reusable water bottles and fill it from our Flowater station in the lobby. It&rsquo;s important to stay hydrated!</p>",
