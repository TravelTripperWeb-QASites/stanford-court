Here is a list of <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">Stanford Court Hotel&rsquo;s</a> favorite local restaurants with the most stunning interior design.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/dining/\">Seven Stills</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Nob Hill</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our revamped restaurant &amp; bar is the optimal spot to kick back with specialty cocktails, spirits, and craft ales from our partners Seven Stills Brewery &amp; Distillery. The sleek new look features chic brass, blackened steel, saturated jewel tones, leather furnishings, and accents of fun, glossy reds set against wood herringbone flooring, and cream colored walls. The dynamic social space is driven by beer and whiskey tastings and a fun, free-flowing vibe. Mounted on the ceiling of the hotel&rsquo;s bar is a still from the legendary car chase in the 1968 movie &ldquo;Bullitt&rdquo; starring Steve McQueen.

Its bright interior is grounded with teak accents and an emerald green, and brass chandeliers of lotus flowers a reminisce of Hong Kong vintage. The northern part of its dining room lends views to the Transamerica Pyramind -- and the food reviews for Mister Jiu&rsquo;s are stellar. Book a table in advance and enjoy a truly elevated meal in Chinatown.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://leossf.com/\">Leo&rsquo;s Oyster Bar</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Financial District</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Named by Bon Appetit Magazine as the best design restaurant of 2016 and featured in Architectural Digest, Leo&rsquo;s is a favorite among architects for its simplistic, vintage design. Described by its designers Ken Fulk and Jon de la Cruz as &ldquo;1950s Beverly Hills meets Manhattan club,&rdquo; the raw bar is grounded by black and white tiles, while retro wallpaper and pink hues make your eyes dance around the dining rooms. Enjoy raw or cooked oysters, small plates, entrees and cocktails at this desirable dining space.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.baragricole.co/\">Bar Agricole</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">South of Market</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Bar Agricole is housed in a former warehouse and was listed as one of the top restaurants in the city by the SF Chronicle in 2017. Certified as LEED platinum, its outdoor courtyard, herb garden and oak, steel and concrete elements leave nothing to be desired. Chairs are made of hollowed-out oak barrels from Napa Valley, reflecting the contemporary tavern and its focus on natural wines, farmhouse distillery and local, organic food. Take in the large bar space and glass sculpted lights overhead, which are so delicate they appear as fabric.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://theplantcafe.com/\">The Plant Caf&eacute; Organic</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Marina District</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Winner of the Metropolis IIDA Smart Environment Design Award, Plant Caf&eacute; Organic is all things sustainable from top to bottom. It&rsquo;s powered by rooftop solar panels, it features a living wall of plants, reclaimed wood, and the floor is made of recycled tiles and coconut shells. The food is no different: 100 percent organic and sustainable. The Asian-inspired fare is great for a sit down or take out and makes for an excellent lunch option.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://insitu.sfmoma.org/\">In Situ</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">South of Market</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Named best design of the year by Interior Design Magazine, In Situ is the ground floor restaurant at <a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/\">SF MoMa</a>. Its sparse interior and timber ceiling draws you into its space, and raw log tables and minimal art is a favorite among fans of modern design. Dishes at In Situ are ordered by size, so go with friends to sample small portions of New American cuisine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>For advance purchase discounts and other deals, <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/offers/\">check the latest offers</a> at Stanford Court Hotel.</em></p>",
