  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Early Christmas anyone? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re slogging through summer stuck in a cubicle or stuck in hours of traffic every day, we have just the thing you need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Escape to San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Come for a week or weekend. We promise you&rsquo;ll leave merry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It doesn&rsquo;t snow much here, but with all the joy to be found in a San Francisco summer, you can consider this city the West Pole of the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Sure, you won&rsquo;t find a big red sleigh here, but you will find a <a href=\"http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/golden-gate-bridge.html?referrer=http://goldengatebridge.org/visitors/\">big orange bridge</a> you may have heard about.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There aren&rsquo;t any elves bustling about (that we know of), but we do have magical red and green <a href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/transit/how-ride/how-to-cable-cars\">cable cars</a> to ferry you around town. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As for gifts? Here are some of the summertime gifts San Francisco has 2 offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Air</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">First, it&rsquo;s free. Second, and #srsly, the SF summer climate can be a game changer 4 your spirit. The climate here is sublime and even quite &hellip; mystical. Fog rolls in from the bay, sometimes in thick blankets that lay upon the hills, and sometimes in tendrils that weave between the buildings on the city&rsquo;s skyline. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/16/san-francisco-fog_n_5481993.html\">San Francisco fog</a> has almost become an attraction in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">And SF is a great place to beat the heat; average temperatures in July and August typically hang out in the mid-60s and low 70s, making outdoor excursions in and around SF a great way 2 take a midsummer mental break.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Bay</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s ironic, but we&rsquo;ll say it anyway &mdash; for one of the most interesting escapes in SF you need to go to prison. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm\">Alcatraz Island</a> awaits, and it will definitely awaken you out of a midsummer stupor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sftreasureisland.org/\">Treasure Island</a> is a good spot for brunch and beaches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Accessible by private boat or public ferry, <a href=\"http://angelisland.com/\">Angel Island</a> is great 4 hikes and biking, and the views are spectacular.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The SCH Deals&nbsp;</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">And we at Stanford Court are here to make your own personal Christmas in July celebration all the more tempting.
