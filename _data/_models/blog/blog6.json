  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Technology moves head-spinningly fast these days that as we write, dozens of new gadgets and accessories are released all over the world. While some of a traveler&rsquo;s needs may change at the same pace, others are as essential now as they were a century ago.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a>,</strong> we know that many of our guests <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/meetings-and-events/\">travel for business</a> </strong>or are <strong><a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/about/\">frequent leisure travelers</a>.</strong> If that&rsquo;s you, check out our pick of accessories and gadgets that will smooth out your travel experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Must-Have</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Luggage Scale</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this era of luggage restrictions, the ominous airport scale haunts our dreams. Be prepared to beat this enemy by carrying your own scale and weighing everything beforehand. The newest models are lightweight and easy to pack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Techy Stuff</h4>\n<p><strong>Charging Backpack</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first thing everyone needs nowadays is to have all those gadgets with full batteries and ready to go. We wish and hope and pray that we&rsquo;ll find a charging port wherever we go, but if that isn&rsquo;t the case, a backpack that charges up all your electronics will be a lifesaver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Noise-cancelling Headphones/Earphones </strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To get some shut-eye during a red-eye flight, to sleep peacefully when your hotel room overlooks a busy street, or to concentrate while working at a caf&eacute;, look for headphones or earphones (depending on your preference) that cancel unwanted noise. Some models are wireless and pair with your phone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">No-Fuss Packing and Unpacking</h4>\n<p><strong>Packing Cubes</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With airlines restricting suitcase sizes more and more, we need to figure out ways to fit everything we need in the right sized bag. Although packing cubes have been around for a while, the newest versions are lighter and easier to organize than earlier models.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-crease Shirt and Blouse Case</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you need to impress clients with your brilliant proposal or when you manage to land a table in that new up-and-coming restaurant, you want to look your best. Forget about packing a steamer or iron - instead, these cases will keep your shirt or blouse, crisp, wrinkle-free and ready to wear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Just for Fun</h4>\n<p><strong>Snapchat Video Recording Spectacles</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When all you want are 10-second videos of your adventures (or misadventures) to share with the Snapchat world, these sunglasses are a mixture of a funky accessory and a hands-free video camera.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Camera Lens for Smartphones</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cell phone cameras have come a long way from their pixelated, low-resolution grandparents. If, however, you want to take your photos to the next level, you can now buy zoom, macro or wide-angle lenses that attach to your smartphone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While these accessories will make traveling easier, you still need a great hotel that will cover all your needs. When<strong> <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/rooms-and-suites/\">booking your room at The Royalton New York</a>,</strong> take a look at our<strong> <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/offers/\">offers</a> </strong>to find the deal that works for you.</p>",
