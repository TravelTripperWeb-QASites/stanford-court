The ice rink is open November through mid-January.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Illuminate SF</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The city-wide &ldquo;festival of light&rdquo; lasts year round, but during the longer nighttime hours of the winter season, Illuminate SF rolls out exciting, new works. The holiday light installations kick off on Thanksgiving Day and can be found throughout the city until New Year&rsquo;s Day. Works range in size from the span of the Bay Bridge to unassuming places, like last year&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.gracecathedral.org/looks-familiar/\">Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder installation at Grace Cathedral</a> in Nob Hill.

Revelers partake in caroling, games and a costume competition. Toys are collected for children in need of holiday cheer. This year&rsquo;s SantaCon is set for Dec. 8, so don&rsquo;t forget to pack your Santa suit!&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf Lighted Boat Parade</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The annual <a href=\"http://www.fishermanswharf.org/\">Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf Lighted Boat Parade</a> is a SF holiday favorite since its inception in 1994.
