We recommend you enjoy the city like a local and take advantage of all the dynamic performances that come through. Here we&rsquo;ve compiled the concerts we&rsquo;re most looking forward to this fall.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Karl Denson&rsquo;s Tiny Universe, White Denim @ The Fillmore</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Tenor-saxophonist <a href=\"http://karldenson.com/\">Karl Denson</a> just finished the No Filter tour with The Rolling Stones in Europe, and now he is putting on a few shows of his own music project, Karl Denson&rsquo;s Tiny Universe. Denson has played with Lenny Kravitz and My Morning Jacket, to name a few. Along with Denson is <a href=\"http://www.whitedenimmusic.com/\">White Denim</a>, a rock band from Austin, TX, known for their catchy tunes and prog-rock influences.
