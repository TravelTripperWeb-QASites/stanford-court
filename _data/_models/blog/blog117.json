  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Castro is one of SF&rsquo;s most unique and historic neighborhoods. It gets its name from Jos&eacute; Antonio Castro, a leader in the Mexican army and acting governor of Alta California in the mid-1800s. While the neighborhood and its most recognizable landmark &mdash; the iconic Castro Theatre movie house &mdash; bear the commandant&rsquo;s name, that&rsquo;s not what makes The Castro famous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />In the 1960s and 1970s, The Castro emerged as a hub of LGBT activism. The intersection of 18th and Castro is where many historic events, marches, and protests have taken and continue to take place. The neighborhood was home to Harvey Milk, who moved from New York City to San Francisco in 1972 amid a migration of LGBT men to the area. Milk went on to become the first openly gay official in the history of California when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where he helped to pass new gay rights ordinances in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Today, the neighborhood remains a center for LGBT culture &mdash; as well as delicious food, drinks, and lovely, walkable streets.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Eat&nbsp;</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">From upscale to casual, there are many dining options in The Castro. Here&rsquo;s a couple to stir your appetite. For sushi, <a href=\"http://places.singleplatform.com/restaurant-eiji/menu?ref=google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out Eiji</a> &mdash; it&rsquo;s low key, high quality, and comfortable.
