That&rsquo;s thanks to <a href=\"https://www.daylighted.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Daylighted</a>, the technology behind the SmArtGallery. It&rsquo;s Daylighted that curates local work by local artists and displays them for your viewing pleasure. That said, we got the chance to catch up with Alex Cammarano, the co-founder of Daylighted. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Stanford Court: How did you get the idea to start Daylighted?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Daylighted:</strong> The idea to start Daylighted was about three years ago. I was trying out photography, so I bought a camera and I took a lot of photos while traveling in the US. And then I put those photos on social media like everybody does...on Instagram and on Facebook. On Instagram, I just started discovering a lot of artists, like real artists, not novice photographers like me. I would spend hours on Instagram just scrolling through artwork. And then I realized &mdash; I didn't have much opportunity to discover art.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Art can be, you know, difficult to access. It's stuck in art galleries, museums. But if you're not really interested in it, you'll never go for it. That was my case. After spending hours on Instagram I was like, \"Oh, my God, I really like it. I really have a lot of good emotions around art, and I want more of it.\" I decided to work on a little solution to have a stream of artwork on a screen in my living room, so I would not spend that much time on my phone&rsquo;s small screen. Instead, I would access that content automatically on the screen. We also ended up realizing that a lot of people like me would enjoy having more access to art. So we started working with a few hotels, and they found that it was a great idea to connect their guests and their clients to the local art communities &mdash; using their existing equipment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Would you give a short synopsis of how the SmArtGallery works?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: Yeah, of course. There's a platform where artists upload their content and write about themselves and make their art available for any places to display it on their screens. The SmArtGallery is a little dongle we plug in the back of a screen in a hotel lobby, in a restaurant, in a coffee shop, or in any public place, and then it rotates artwork. And so the venue can, at any time...go on the platform and decide, \"Hey, today, we want this specific art piece,\" or \"We want this specific art gallery,\" or \"We want that museum's exhibition and display it on all of our screens.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">For the viewers, there is a mobile application where you can <a href=\"https://www.daylighted.com/explore/collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">learn about the artwork</a>; you can talk to the artists, and you can even buy the art. In a nutshell, it's bringing the gallery experience to where people go...Bringing the art to the people.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The hotels or the customer can curate what art they'd like to see. Does Daylighted also curate?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: Exactly. There are several different ways to work with us. There's a platform where the hotel has full control (they can curate themselves).They have a lot of filters where they can say, &ldquo;I want only only local art because I want to show the local communities, or I want only blue, or I want only seascapes.&rdquo; They can filter, and create their own channels, or for their own exhibitions. But most of the hotels don't really have time to do that, so they reach out to us or on-demand exhibitions. For a hotel like Stanford Court, we will create specific exhibitions for their events. Like right now they&rsquo;re doing a renovation, and we have a system renovation exhibition on their screen to let the guests know about it. But most of the time, we create a local exhibition for them with art galleries or local artists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">About the art curated for Stanford Court, have you noticed any particular trends or any particular artists that have garnered a following through the display at the hotel?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: Yeah, you know, it's interesting...a lot of people think art is intimidating; a lot of people think art is not for them; that it's something serious, that it's expensive, that you need to learn to understand. But what we found is that the guests at the Stanford Court love it, and what Stanford Court loves is when art is fun &mdash; when art is accessible. It's always local at Stanford Court, because it's important for us to promote the <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/explore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local community</a>. But, we also want something groundbreaking, very fun, and very accessible. We have a lot of calligraphy. There's also a lot of digital art and some paintings. We had a few digital exhibitions as well where the art was animated. It's not a traditional artwork; it's moving art. It's a cinemagraph where there's a solo piece that&rsquo;s moving or some video as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Are there any particular artists whose work comes up on a regular basis &mdash; ones that mesh with the Stanford Court mentality?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: &nbsp;I haven't checked their past exhibition, but off the top of my head, <a href=\"https://ericjoyner.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eric Joyner</a> comes to mind. He is an artist that painted for about 20 years. And he only painted robots and donuts in different situations. They're adorable. People love it because it reminds them of their youth &mdash; you know, the robots and the donuts, that's what you used to like when you were a kid. They're really funny; they're very accessible. They're affordable &mdash; &nbsp;we sold a lot of pieces there as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">We also had an exhibition with <a href=\"http://dydyk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher Dydyk</a>. He's an artist that has exhibited at the SFMOMA gallery. He is a photographer that takes a lot of pictures of the same spot and then juxtaposes them on each other to have this impressionism feeling in the photography. What I love about what he does is, when he'll take those, maybe 100 photos of the same spot, he will take a lot of photos of people, and only select the people that are smiling and include them on top of each other, which makes those photos very colorful and very happy as well. I think that's why it goes well with Stanford Court.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1534284652493\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/large_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" alt=\"daylighted-standford-court\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/large_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/medium_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/small_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/xsmall_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_18254/media/2018-08-14-181040/thumb_daylighted-standford-court.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">We talked about Instagram &mdash; you had mentioned that you were starting to find different artists on Instagram, and that's how you got started with this. Which artists are you following right now?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: On Instagram? That's a very hard question, because since I started Daylighted, I stopped using Instagram. However, there are still many artists on Daylighted that you can follow. I'm thinking of <a href=\"http://www.singingbones.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Laura Park</a> for example, she's an amazing digital artist. And so many other digital artists that are creating a new form of art. We're all used to painting and photography, but there are so many new forms of art that are really difficult to access today, because we don't have a medium. Although there's artwork that is animated, if you don't have the proper screen to watch it, it's stuck on YouTube basically. There's a lot of digital artists to follow &mdash; like <a href=\"http://www.lucaagnani.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luca Agnani</a>. He takes Van Gogh paintings and he animates them. You recognize the Van Gogh paintings right away, but then if you look closely, there's a solo piece of the painting that is animated. That's really gorgeous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">To circle back to Instagram, what we do for the hotel is we give the hotel all the credentials of the artists and the lore of the artwork so they can promote it on Instagram and tell their followers and the community that, \"This month at the Stanford Court, we have these artists or this gallery on exhibition.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Last question: do you have any memorable success stories from Daylighted?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">D: It's a little early to talk about a success story for an artist. It takes a lot of time for an artist to build his reputation and his portfolio. And so I hope, in a few years we'll be able to talk about artist success stories. Right now, we're helping those artists get exposure in meeting places like Stanford Court and other hotels from luxury brands. So not only do we give them exposure to a wider audience, but also we help them with credibility. They can now say, \"I worked at Stanford Court, which is a prestigious location in San Francisco.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">However, what is part of the artist success story is that we have sold hundreds of pieces through our platform. And for us, really, that is the success story. It&rsquo;s every time there is a guest in the hotel that has never been into an art gallery or never really looked at art, sees Daylighted and says, \"Wow, this is pretty cool,\" and they get this little emotional response like, \"I think I like that.\" And they scroll through the tablet, they look at the full exhibition and they look at another piece, and they say, \"Wow, I like this one too.\" And then they start thinking that maybe they like art, but they didn't know it before because they were not exposed to it &mdash; that's the success story, inspiring more people through art.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Liberation Mono'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p>",
