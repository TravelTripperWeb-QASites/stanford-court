Here at SCH we&rsquo;ve made a list of <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/the-most-scenic-running-routes-in-sf/\">the most scenic running routes in SF</a>, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a morning run, maybe this 2-mile loop will suit your needs. It passes through Chinatown, the Financial District and reaching the San Francisco Bay. From SCH, head east on California Street, toward the bay. California eventually dead ends on Drumm Street, where you&rsquo;ll veer right onto Market Street toward the water. Pass the ferry building (feel free to check out running paths in adjacent Sue Bierman Park), then head back in to SCH on Washington Street. Once you reach Powell Street, head south until your reach Stanford Court Hotel. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/YNhNaKH5aM32\">See route here.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Tune up, tone up</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco is bike-friendly with designated lanes for cyclists.
