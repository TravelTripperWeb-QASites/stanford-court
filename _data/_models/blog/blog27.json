	"long_description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people want to know, just who exactly is Stan? You might have seen him around the website and he makes an appearance on our blog every once in awhile, so we thought we would share a little bit more about the Most Interesting Man in Nob Hill.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stan is the man! That goes without saying, but what you might not know about him is that Stan is our go-to person in the hotel for </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">everything.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He actually grew up in San Francisco and knows the history of Nob Hill better than anyone. He&rsquo;s the guy we go to when we need an idea for the unique images on our room key cards or a new background on our chalkboard wall in the lobby.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a background in IT, Stan advises us on the latest products we need to make our guests&rsquo; stay as comfortable and convenient as possible. Those iPads in the lobby for guests to use? Yup, totally Stan&rsquo;s idea. He is a food and beverage connoisseur and samples everything we serve at our breakfast buffet and continental breakfast. He </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">insisted</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that we serve Equator Coffee in the lobby for our guests.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But most of all, Stan is funny and adventurous. He loves exploring San Francisco on our bikes, running around the Nob Hill hills, and pumping iron in our fitness center. Committed to making Stanford Court more green, Stan led our Earth Day efforts and is constantly coming up with new ideas for us to take better care of the environment.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to know more about Stan?
