  "long_description": "<p>We are very excited to share how you can enjoy San Francisco through our brand new blog series. We are so lucky to be in the heart of the action in Nob Hill. Coffee lovers delight &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got so many good coffee shops to choose from. Today, we&rsquo;ve narrowed it to down to three of our favorites to get some of the best cups of joe in SF!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"Flour &amp; Co\" href=\"http://www.flourandco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flour &amp; Co</a>: This adorable and cozy bakery serves delicious tarts, breads, cakes, cookies &amp; pies, and coffee. All of their baked goods are made from all-natural and often organic ingredients. What we really love about their shop is they change things up with the seasons so everything is very fresh. Also, Flour &amp; Co is all about giving back to the community. Each month they change up a charity they like to give back. Customers are welcome to donate and they will match your donation at the end of the month! This month&rsquo;s Raising Dough campaign is with <a title=\"GiveMeTap\" href=\"http://www.givemetap.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GiveMeTap</a>. Check out their <a title=\"blog\" href=\"https://flourandco.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog</a> for more information!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"ContraBand Coffee:\" href=\"http://www.contrabandcoffeebar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ContraBand Coffee</a>: We are big fans of this coffee shop because you&rsquo;ll see locals hanging out at this joint. The owners work really hard to give their customers high-quality caffeinated drips. For example, you can order items like the &ldquo;Iced Separator,&rdquo; which is espresso, coconut water, coconut cream, almond milk, honey, and cinnamon. Sounds pretty spectacular right? They have free Wifi so it&rsquo;s a great place to get some work done or to even just surf the internet. Grab a seat at the counter or one of their community tables if you&rsquo;re looking to chat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"What A Grind Coffee House:\" href=\"http://www.whatagrindcafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What A Grind Coffee House</a>: Whether you&rsquo;ve got a long day ahead or just need a cup of joe, this coffee shop will fulfill your cravings for morning to early evening goodies. As you enter this neighborhood shop, you will be greeted by friendly smiles. We highly recommend the Mocha! -STAN</p>",
