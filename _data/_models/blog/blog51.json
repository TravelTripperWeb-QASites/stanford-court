The life force that keeps San Francisco going on cold, misty mornings and the hearty soup that warms our bones. Frankly, it&rsquo;s a staple of the Bay Area diet. Now that #NationalClamChowderDay is coming up, here are the Stanford Court picks for our favorite dish in the City by the Bay:<br /> <br /> <strong>Pier 39</strong><br /> The Embarcadero &amp; Beach Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94133<br /> <br /> Pier 39 often gets pegged as a tourist trap. After all, it has the shops, the carousel, the aquarium, and the visitor center. But forget all that. <a href=\"https://www.pier39.com/\">Pier 39</a> has the view of the bay and the Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf seals lounging. That&rsquo;s the view you get while enjoying your clam chowder. Of course, there&rsquo;s better in city by the bay, but that view &ndash; it&rsquo;s unique. Go there at least once to cross it off your bucket list.<br /> <br /> <strong>Bakery Boudin</strong><br /> 251 Geary Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94102<br /> <br /> Order the clam chowder here just to get the sourdough. Served in the traditional bread bowl, this is a SF favorite for both the chowder and the bread. Using the same recipe since 1849, <a href=\"https://boudinbakery.com/\">Bakery Boudin&rsquo;s</a> claim to fame is as the original sourdough bread bakery in San Francisco. These days there&rsquo;s quite a few locations around the city, including one in Union Square, making it a win-win for Stanford Court guests, especially on a chilly San Francisco day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Woodhouse Fish Company</strong><br /> 2073 Market Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94114<br /> <br /> Woodhouse Fish Company has some of the best clam chowder in the city &ndash; creamy, thick, and a good portion of clams. It&rsquo;s not the closest to Stanford Court, but it&rsquo;s not too long either. It&rsquo;s a straight shot on the train. But what&rsquo;s really gr8 about <a href=\"http://www.woodhousefish.com/\">Woodhouse Fish Company</a> is that it&rsquo;s always a sure bet. After your chowder, order your lobster roll or the fish &lsquo;n&rsquo; chips. They&rsquo;re both delicious.<br /> <br /> <strong>Anchor Oyster Bar</strong><br /> 579 Castro Street<br /> San Francisco, CA 94114<br /> <br /> We &lt;3 this place. If you&rsquo;re looking for a spot with a lot of character and also a great bowl of clam chowder, <a href=\"http://anchoroysterbar.com/\">Anchor Oyster Bar</a> is it. Located in the Castro district, Anchor Oyster Bar is great if you&rsquo;re looking to see another side of the city and also eat well. Recommended by Michelin and Zagat, as well as many local guides, this chowder lives up to the expectations.<br /> <br /> ***<br /> If you&rsquo;re looking for dessert, check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/food/best-nob-hill-desserts/\">sweets in Nob Hill</a>.</p>",
