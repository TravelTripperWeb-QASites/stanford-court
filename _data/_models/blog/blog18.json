  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A neighborhood market managed to become one of the top food destinations in <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/location/\">New York City</a>&mdash;and the world. How did it happen? Who&rsquo;s to receive a standing ovation? And why is Chelsea Market such a hit? The <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a> has the scoop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now a quintessential part of Chelsea&rsquo;s many perks, <a href=\"http://chelseamarket.com/\">Chelsea Market</a> began as part of the National Biscuit Company, more commonly known as Nabisco. In the late 19th Century and part of the 20th Century, the complex was nothing more than a factory. However, the company moved out in 1959 and the building remained forgotten until it was bought in 1990. Chelsea Market was inaugurated in 1997, with much of its original structure, brick walls and Nabisco murals intact. This unpolished, urban look worked-people began flocking to the newly opened food shops and stores.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1523548272026\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" width=\"771\" height=\"514\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/large_royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/medium_royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/small_royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/xsmall_royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14576/media/2018-04-12-115110/thumb_royalton-chelsea-market-shops.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the years, Chelsea Market has gained a reputation as a gourmet food paradise where one can spend an entire day sampling a little bit of this and that.
