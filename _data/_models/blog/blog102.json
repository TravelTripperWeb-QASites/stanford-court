  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ready to hear something obvious? Ok, here goes. There are plenty of ways to spend money in San Francisco and have a good time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Told you it was obvious.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">But, (prepare for the segway &hellip;) do you know what may not be so obvious? There are also plenty of ways to spend #ZeroDollars and also have a gr8 time in SF.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&rsquo;t believe us? Ok, well now you made us a little upset. Hold on a sec while we calm down &hellip;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ok. We&rsquo;re going to prove it to you. And we&rsquo;re going to do it with not one &hellip;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Not two.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Not even three or four.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">But FIVE things to do in SF that require no credit, debit, cash, or bartering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Just show up and enjoy!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Palace of Fine Arts</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s over 100 years old but it may as well be a thousand years old and from another planet &mdash; the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/planyourvisit/palace-of-fine-arts.htm\">Palace of FIne Arts</a> is iconic and beautiful, with Latin inscriptions adorning its walls and swans lounging in its lagoon. Its various walkways are well worth a wander if you&rsquo;re in SF. It was originally constructed for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition to house art exhibits, and, as you can see above, it&rsquo;s a work of art itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Baker Beach</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Chances are you&rsquo;ve seen <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/planyourvisit/baker-beach.htm\">Baker Beach</a> on a postcard with the glow of a West Coast sunset glittering off the sand and waves, the Golden Gate Bridge radiant in the background. Stop by for a relaxing walk or picnic and take in panoramic views of the bridge and the ocean. Make your own postcards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The California Coastal Trail</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">While you&rsquo;re at Baker Beach, you can check out the <a href=\"http://www.californiacoastaltrail.info/hikers/hikers_main.php\">California Coastal Trail</a>. It&rsquo;s 1,200 miles long, but don&rsquo;t worry! You don&rsquo;t have to do all of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You can hop on the trail near Baker Beach and walk about 2.7 miles through <a href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/\">the Presidio</a>. Along the way you&rsquo;ll see rocky coastal bluffs, great ocean views, and your reward at the end is the Golden Gate Bridge itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sea Lions at Pier 39</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There&rsquo;s a lot to see and do at <a href=\"https://www.pier39.com/\">Pier 39</a> &mdash; it&rsquo;s basically an outdoor shopping mall. But malls aren&rsquo;t full of free things, and we promised you free things! Well, here you go: check our Pier 39&rsquo;s famous sea lions. Listen, nobody planned this. The sea lions &mdash; up to 1300 of them &mdash; just showed up. And because California Law gives marine mammals the right of way, the sea lions basically takeover entire docks and do as they please. But they won&rsquo;t take your money.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Fort Point</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Like many historic military fortifications, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fopo/index.htm\">Fort Point</a> is now filled with sightseers and cameras instead of soldiers and cannons. It was built during the Gold Rush to protect the Bay against foreign invasion. But now it&rsquo;s a park. Guided tours are free!</p>"
