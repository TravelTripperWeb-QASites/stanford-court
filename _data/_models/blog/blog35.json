We are proud to be a quintessential example of these two pillars- located in the historical Nob Hill district we have a strong reverence for the past, yet have a deep appreciation for the infusion of technology. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One benefit of being at the intersection of past and present is that we can offer our guests an experience of both. We are always looking for ways to preserve our city in new and innovative ways. Like every spot in San Francisco,we offer recycling, compost, and landfill disposable. Our desire to keep on going green led us to create additional initiatives for our guests.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are excited to share some great promotions, activities and charitable endeavors in a few weeks as we celebrate Earth Day in April, but in the meantime we wanted to introduce our Eco-Map that highlights local businesses and points of interest that are doing their part in being green. Whether it is using sustainable methods, sourcing from local farms, or cutting down on waste, we appreciate their work in keeping San Francisco a lovely place for residents and visitors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, put on your walking shoes and head out to visit these spots! You will make others green with envy!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/446_617_1962/media/2017-02-24-105301/41.png\" /></span></p>",
