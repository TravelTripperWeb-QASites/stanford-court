  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Let&rsquo;s get practical. You&rsquo;re coming to San Francisco, and, to make things even better, let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re staying with us! We&rsquo;d love to have you. But how are you going to get here?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">As with most things these days, you have options. And we&rsquo;re here to help you find out what they are. However you get to us from the airport, we hope to see you soon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>1. Bay Area Rapid Transit</strong> --- Hop on the <a title=\"BART Rapid Rail\" href=\"http://www.bart.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BART Rapid Rail</a> and the trip from the airport to Stanford Court will be about 30 minutes and stress-free. You&rsquo;ll get off at Powell Street Station. From there it&rsquo;s about a 10 to 15-minute walk to the hotel at 905 California Street.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2. SamTrans</strong> --- <a title=\"Take a bus\" href=\"http://www.samtrans.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Take a bus</a> and you&rsquo;ll be to us in about 45 minutes. It&rsquo;s the Pittsburg/Bay Point bus you want, and it will drop you off at the Powell Street Station as well. Then a short walk and you&rsquo;ve arrived.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>#ProTip</strong>: We here in the Bay Area call all public transportation &ldquo;Muni&rdquo; (mew - nee), so you now speak a little San Francisco.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>3. Rent a car</strong> --- <a title=\"SFO&rsquo;s car rental setup\" href=\"http://www.flysfo.com/to-from/rental-cars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SFO&rsquo;s car rental setup</a> is super convenient and all-in-one. It has all the major car rental brands. If you go this route, &nbsp;it'll take you about 30 minutes to drive to Sanford Court via US-101.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>4. Taxi Cab</strong> --- If riding in a traditional cab is more your style, you can do that too. <a title=\"Getting a taxi\" href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/taxi/taxi-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting a taxi</a> from the airport to Stanford Court will likely cost you between <a title=\"$55 and $97\" href=\"https://www.taxifarefinder.com/main.php?city=SF&amp;from=San+Francisco+Airport%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+United+States&amp;to=Stanford+Court+Hotel%2C+California+Street%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+United+States&amp;fromCoord=37.6213129,-122.3789554&amp;toCoord=37.7915052,-122.40959809999998\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$55 and $97</a> depending on traffic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>5. Party bus</strong> --- Could be cool, right? &nbsp;There are a bunch of other options, including airporter buses, pre-arranged vans, shared-ride vans, taxis, limousines, and charter bus operators. <a title=\"SFO has a breakdown of that here\" href=\"http://www.flysfo.com/to-from/ground-transportation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SFO has a breakdown of that here</a>. And, of course, Uber and Lyft are always just a screen tap away.</p>"
