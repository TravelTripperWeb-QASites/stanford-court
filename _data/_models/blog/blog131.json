Sometimes being a spectator may be more desirable. Anyway, the monthly SF critical mass gets dressed up every Halloween for a proper bike ride, which begins @ Justin Herman Plaza on Friday, Oct. 27 @ 5:30. This event draws a lot of participants; costumed bike parade ensues. <a href=\"http://sf.funcheap.com/critical-mass-halloween-bike-ride-sf/\">Check out more here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Horror Movie Trivia + Comedy Night</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">If you&rsquo;re a horror movie buff and enjoy a drink, this is the spot for you.
