While the bustling city is invigorating, everyone needs to retreat and unplug every now and then. Next time you feel nature calling, explore the incredible trails at Lands End.</p>\n<h4>Lands End History</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the name suggests, this trail is reminiscent of the end of the world - a rocky and wild place, waiting to be unearthed. The trail is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and offers a respite from the city while highlighting the area&rsquo;s history. And what a history! Lands End is famous for many shipwrecks that have occurred as a result of the rocky shores, fog and treacherous tides. &nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Top Sights</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If it&rsquo;s your first time at Lands End, your first stop should be <strong>Lands End Lookout</strong>, a visitor&rsquo;s center showcasing exhibits on the area&rsquo;s history and geography.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ruins of <strong>Sutro Baths</strong> and the popular <strong>restaurant Cliff House</strong> are very close to each other. &nbsp;For more than 100 years, Cliff House has been a fine dining destination overlooking the Seal Rocks. In 2005, the building was expertly restored to its former glory and continues to be a must visit. The Sutro Baths were constructed by millionaire Adolph Sutro as a public bathhouse that sought to educate visitors on the area&rsquo;s nature while offering inexpensive swimming facilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last but not least, <strong>Lands End Labyrinth</strong> is located off the Mile Rock Beach side trail. It was created in 2004 by Eduardo Aguilar who envisioned a zen-like space offering a relaxing walk.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1543252639290\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/large_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" alt=\"lands-end-labyrinth-golden-gate-bridge-in-background\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/large_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/medium_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/small_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/xsmall_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_901_21424/media/2018-11-26-121630/thumb_stanford-court-exploring-lands-end.png\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">All About the Trail</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lands End may seem deceptively small on a map, but on closer inspection you may be surprised to find an intricate network of trails perfect for trail running, biking and even exploring with your dog (on a leash)!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before heading out, keep in mind that Lands End is known as a wild trail for a reason. Some sections are best suited for hybrid bikes and comfortable shoes, while others require mountain bikes or trail shoes and hiking boots with decent grip &mdash; especially after rainy days. However, the section between the Lands End Overlook parking lot and the Mile Rock Overlook is ADA accessible. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/upload/Lands-end-brochre.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lands End trail map</a> to plan a trip that suits your needs. &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SF&rsquo;s Coastal Trail crosses Lands End from end to end, offering unparalleled views of Golden Gate Bridge and connecting the trail&rsquo;s highlights. It is an easy to moderate trail given that some sections are wide and flat, while others climb moderately steep hills, traverse woods and take you through narrow routes with steep drop-offs and cliff edges. &nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Pamper Yourself After a Day on the Trail</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you want to stretch in our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/amenities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fitness center</a> or take a nap after your day out, Stanford Court has all the amenities you need to recover.</p>",
