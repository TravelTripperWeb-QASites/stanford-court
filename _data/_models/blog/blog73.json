  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/oWgtpm\">Maurizio Pesce</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">One of the biggest developer festivals is just around the corner, and just down the bay - it's time again for Google I/O. That said, if you&rsquo;re coming into town for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/io\">Google I/O</a> consider taking a mini-vacay and spending a few days in San Francisco. In the meantime, here are the sessions we&rsquo;re looking forward 2 @ Google I/O:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Assisting the Driver: From Android Phones to Android Cars, Wednesday, May 17 @ 2 p.m.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In this session led by Yao Chen and Chen Xiao, developers will discover how better evolve their apps to the automotive platform, with the goal of making the Android experience a seamless transition from phone to car. Just think with Android already in the car, does that mean it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it makes it into the driver&rsquo;s seat?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Future of Fabric: Building Momentum at Google, Thursday, May 17 @ 10:30 a.m.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In this session, James Tamplin, Timothy Jordon, Rich Paret, and Jason Titus will discuss one of Google&rsquo;s newest acquisitions, Fabric, a mobile development platform (formerly of Twitter), the updates they&rsquo;re making and how they plan to use it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Supercharged Live, Thursday, May 17 @ 1:30 p.m.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Are a subscriber to Supercharged? Well, here&rsquo;s your chance to see Paul Lewis and Surma build live, right in front of your eyes. Although they haven&rsquo;t released any details on what they will be building, if it&rsquo;s like any of their other shows, it will be jammed packed full of tips.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Designing Screen Interfaces for VR, Friday May 19 @ 11:30 a.m.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We&rsquo;re pretty interested in VR here @ SCH which is why we&rsquo;re especially looking forward to this session. Led by Chris McKenzie and Adam Glazier, this session prompts designers to think of VR outside of the traditional 3D format and to re-think how we interact with screens and content.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20. That&rsquo;s even more excuse to stop by SCH after Google I/O.&nbsp;</em></p>",
