  "long_description": "<p>Spring is officially here (well for the rest of the united states), but we can&rsquo;t really complain about our weather here in San Francisco. Regardless, this is one of my favorite times to spend time in our gorgeous parks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grab one of our free bike rentals with helmets (safety first) with road map and explore our city. Ask our concierge where you can stop for some appetizing bites to eat on your picnic.&nbsp; Some local shops I love include: (<em>THE Fridge? next to the bell desk</em>), <em>Eastern Bakery</em> and <em>Boudin Bakery</em>. <em>Le Beau Market</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your picnic ready to go then get ready to explore the city! One of my favorites parks to hang out in includes: Golden State Park, Huntington Park, and Yerba Buena Gardens. Also, another great stop is to bike over to the Ferry Building and get a variety of delicious meats, cheese, and wines all from local artisans. Then you can enjoy the view of the Bay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, as many of you may know our weather can be quite unpredictable so be sure to check your favorite weather app before heading out the door. We highly suggest you follow the Twitter account @karlthefog. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to know if and when the fog may come in real time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
