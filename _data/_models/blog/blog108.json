  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to leave the house before a cup of coffee. This doesn&rsquo;t change during travel, and at <a title=\"#StanfordCourtSF\" href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/dining/\">#StanfordCourtSF</a> we offer the local, organic SF coffee brew, <a title=\"Equator\" href=\"https://www.equatorcoffees.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Equator</a>. It not only packs a distinct, smooth taste, but is recognized for meeting a high standard of its social and environmental impact.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To tell you a little back story, Equator coffee started out in nearby Marin County in 1995, when Brooke McDonnell and Helen Russell started roasting coffee in their garage. True to the Bay Area spirit, the two business partners focused on creating a brew that not only tasted good, but also used sustainable measures and a positive social impact.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">McDonnell then went to Guatemala to scout out coffee farms and make connections with workers and farms directly. This eventually led to Finca Sophia, a farm founded in 2008 in Panama, located at 2,100 meters up in the mountain, owned by McDonnell and Russell. The business is noted for paying quality incentives to its farmers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In 2016, the pair&rsquo;s fair practices earned them the National Small Business of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration because of their leading role in sustainability and social responsibility. It also boasts being the very first coffee roaster in California to seal the title of a certified B Corporation, which includes rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Equator Coffee can be found in <a title=\"six locations\" href=\"https://www.equatorcoffees.com/all-locations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">six locations</a> in the Bay Area, with two located in San Francisco.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Join us for breakfast, featuring an assortment of fresh baked pastries, local organic juices and a delicious buffet breakfast.
