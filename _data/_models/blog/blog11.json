There&rsquo;s something beautiful in every direction: you can see Alcatraz, Grace Cathedral, the TransAmerica Building, the Financial District and more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Golden Gate Bridge Look-out:&nbsp;</strong>If you&rsquo;re going to head to the Golden Gate Bridge (<a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/offers/\">first check out our Bike the Bridge Package</a>) then you will be in for some great views of the city, Sausalito, Baker Beach, and more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Twin Peaks:&nbsp;</strong>This iconic spot allows you to see almost an entire 360 degree view of San Francisco. You can drive to the top or make it a workout by climbing the peaks on the steady incline terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Observation Deck at the deYoung Museum</strong>:&nbsp;If hiking Twin Peaks is not your thing then head to the deYoung Museum to visit their free Observation Deck (no museum admission fee required). Take the elevator to the top floor and see great views of Golden Gate Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, and parts of San Francisco.</p>",
