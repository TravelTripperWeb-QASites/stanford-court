In 1947, McQueen joined the United States Marine Corps and was promoted to private first class and assigned to an armored unit. Initially he reverted to his prior rebelliousness and was demoted to private seven times.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">McQueen began his acting career in the 1950s in New York City, appearing in stage productions. In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He got a big break when he starred alongside Frank Sinatra in Never So Few in 1959. He got a lot of big roles after that and enjoyed a successful career and in 1972, McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor. He disappeared from the spotlight for four years and focused on riding his motorcycle and traveling around in his motorhome.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">McQueen was an avid motorcycle and race car enthusiast. When he had the opportunity to drive in a movie, he performed many of his own stunts, including some of the car chases in <em>Bullit</em>. In 1979, McQueen was diagnosed with cancer and in 1980 passed away at the young age of 50 years old.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Steve McQueen leaves behind an incredible legacy of 27 films, including one of our favorites, <em>Bullit</em>. We hope you will join us in celebrating his birthday.</p>"
