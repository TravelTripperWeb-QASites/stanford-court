  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Given it&rsquo;s open-minded nature and acceptance of things a little bit weird, queer and newfangled, it&rsquo;s no wonder that San Francisco has a long history of nurturing new song writing styles, experimental music festivals and hippie gatherings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The city is home to The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Steve Miller Band, Train, DJ Shadow, Xiu Xiu, Ty Segall, and Tycho to name a few. We at <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">Stanford Court Hotel</a> haven&rsquo;t overlooked this characteristic -- that&rsquo;s why we invite you to enjoy our new music room, which features a record player and our favorite vinyls from local bands. Guests can put a fresh record on the turntable, kick back and enjoy the tunes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">For those visiting for the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival Aug. 10-12, check out our Outside Lands Package to save up to 20% off your stay! <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#outside-lands-save-20percent\">Details here.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Finally, if you&rsquo;re going to San Francisco and you&rsquo;re a vinyl collector or novice, make sure to browse some of the legendary record stores found around the city. Enjoy the experience of listening to an album front to back, without any interruptions. There&rsquo;s a reason vinyl still isn&rsquo;t dead.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.amoeba.com/\">Amoeba Music</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Located in an old bowling alley, Amoeba Records is an independent music chain that comes in impressive proportions. With new and used records, books, and more, shoppers easily while away time browsing the wide selection at this Haight Ashbury mainstay since 1990. Drop in, listen to the music they&rsquo;re spinning, dig through some record crates and drop into any nearby eatery, caf&eacute; on Haight or relax in Golden Gate Park, just a block away. 1855 Haight St.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.rookyricardos.com/\">Rooky Ricardo&rsquo;s Records</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">A SF institution, filled with oldies records, classic rock, and soul music, Rooky Ricardo&rsquo;s is a standing testimony to the longevity of records and potential for record stores. Listening stations give you the full experience. Not sure where to start? The owner Dick has a reputation of picking out records you&rsquo;ll treasure forever. Make sure to have some time on your hands to check selection of LP&rsquo;s and 45&rsquo;s -- it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the colorful album art and soul tunes. 419 Haight St.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.strandedrecords.com/\">Stranded Records</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Owned by the well-respected record label <a href=\"https://www.superiorviaduct.com/\">Superior Viaduct</a>, Stranded Records took over the space of the SF staple Aquarius Records in 2016. Still, the iconic spot features the label&rsquo;s obscure, reissued releases, as well as other records that you won&rsquo;t find in other record stores.
