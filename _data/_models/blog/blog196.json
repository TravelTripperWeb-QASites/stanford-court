Its dog-friendly outdoor seating ensures that you and your best friend can enjoy brunch together. We recommend the lemon souffle pancake for its heavenly fluffiness. The crab cake benedict is also a favorite, with a generous helping of fresh crab meat. Top off your brunch with Mymy&rsquo;s fresh mimosas or a bloody mary and enjoy a late morning or early afternoon in Nob Hill.
