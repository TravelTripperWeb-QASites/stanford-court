When you visit San Francisco you will see that there are details to be found on every building of every block (<a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/tsc/eco-map/\" target=\"_blank\">check out our Eco-Map for some of our favorite spots</a>). From the French Gothic architecture of Grace Cathedral to the modern buildings of the Financial District, San Francisco is a city that draws you in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At our hotel we believe that details big and small make a big impact on our guests. We purposefully pay attention to the little things. Sure, we have Autobahn wi-fi throughout the hotel that is super fast and a concierge that gives the best advice, but here are some of the super cool things we offer our guests:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nod Hill</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; A variety of pillow types so you can sleep comfortably.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Live at the Lift</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ndash; Music from the Bay Area&nbsp;greats playing in the elevators.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Snail Mail</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Postcards in the room and a front desk that takes care of the postage, yep, we got it!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these little things matter so if you like what you see, share it! Tag us in your photos @StanfordCourtSF</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/446_617_1962/media/2017-02-24-104705/40.jpg\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
