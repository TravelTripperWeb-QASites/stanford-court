  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco is a paradise of food options for vegetarians and vegans, and the sheer amount of meatless fare is something fierce. To help narrow down your options, here we&rsquo;ve made up a list of our favorite plant-based eateries for you to try out. Vegetarians have no business eating sad salads here in SF, so here&rsquo;s a round-up of the best vegetarian options out there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://gracias-madre.com/\"><strong>Gracias Madre</strong><br /></a>It&rsquo;s no mistake that this is at the top of our list. This vegan restaurant in The Mission could convince a carnivore that veganism is their destined path. Gracias Madre features vegan Mexican food, playing with unusual ingredients and seasonings to create thoughtful plates. For an appetizer, try the colifl&oacute;r frito - fried cauliflower topped with cashew cheese that won&rsquo;t make you miss any of that orange nacho stuff. As a main entree, platanos with mole negro is a fantastic, savory and sweet dish. And to pull it all together, order a bloody mary with organic sake, a creative twist on an old favorite. Outdoor seating is available, and we recommend you make a reservation, as Gracias Madre is a pretty popular place.<br /><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Gracias+Madre/@37.7615715,-122.4190799,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf0ec55539199c7f9!8m2!3d37.7615715!4d-122.4190799?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj02bDsuevWAhWHwiYKHQnbB7gQ_BIIigEwCg\">Located at 2211 Mission Street, San Francisco</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://places.singleplatform.com/love-n-haight-deli--cafe/menu?ref=google\"><strong>Love N Haight Deli</strong><br /></a>This mostly vegan &amp; vegetarian deli offers tasty faux meat, delicious breads (try the Dutch Crunch) and excellent prices. It&rsquo;s a great option if you&rsquo;re in the Haight and looking for a fresh sandwich for lunch. The most popular is their faux duck sandwich topped with crunchy greens. Every part of this deli is well thought-out and tasty.<br /><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Love+N+Haight+Deli+%26+Cafe/@37.771834,-122.4335316,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580a6eae3d24f:0x761eeb6b49da2a88!8m2!3d37.7718298!4d-122.4313429\">Located at 553 Haight Street, San Francisco</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.thaiideavegetariansf.com/menu.aspx\"><strong>Thai Idea Vegetarian</strong><br /></a>Thai food never needed meat for flavor, and the Thai Idea Vegetarian really hits the mark. This cozy spot is open for lunch and dinner, and closed between 3-5 p.m. This vegetarian restaurant is ironically located in the Tenderloin, but the menu is all vegetarian and staff is knowledgeable about different diet restrictions, such as gluten-free or soy-free options, what&rsquo;s vegan or vegetarian. We suggest you try the pumpkin curry, which is bursting with flavor and savory till the last bite. For an appetizer, try their Thai samosas - you won&rsquo;t regret it.<br /><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Thai+Idea+Vegetarian/@37.783457,-122.419116,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x18af84117bd3e9ba!8m2!3d37.783457!4d-122.419116\">Located at 710 Polk Street, San Francisco</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.flyingfalafel.com/\"><strong>The Flying Falafel</strong><br /></a>Get &ldquo;falafelized&rdquo; at this humble counter-service spot in SoMa. The Flying Falafel was originally a stand in a farmer&rsquo;s market, with creator Assaf Pashut hurling falafel balls at unassuming passersby. The falafel&rsquo;s fresh taste and perfect fry has elevated The Flying Falafel into one of the best places to get falafel in the city. We suggest you try the Falafel Frisbee, which is a fresh pita filled with perfectly seasoned falafel. Excellent casual mediterranean lunch.<br /><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/The+Flying+Falafel/@37.7811176,-122.4132904,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80858084e8604451:0x69c81f66fdd25152!8m2!3d37.7811134!4d-122.4111017\">Located at 1051 Market Street, San Francisco </a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://picniconthird.com/menu/\"><strong>Picnic on Third</strong><br /></a>Any day&rsquo;s a day for a picnic at Picnic on Third. This is a great place for lunch if you&rsquo;re spending the day in South Beach. The rustic eatery has a playful, rotating menu with great vegetarian and meat options. The menu changes daily, so ask the server for recommendations. It&rsquo;s a counter service place with meals that have that home cooked care and flavor, and the restaurant prides themselves in serving whole, fresh food. They also have great coffee, and if you want an adult drink with your picnic, they also offer beer and wine.<br /><a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Picnic+On+Third/@37.7816472,-122.3980428,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8085807f2a5682c3:0x2a74c27165e5d07b!8m2!3d37.781643!4d-122.3958541\">Located at 493 3rd Street, San Francisco</a></p>",
