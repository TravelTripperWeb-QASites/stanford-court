  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s been well-documented that San Francisco is the most expensive city in America. We&rsquo;re not here to tell you that it isn&rsquo;t. We know just how easily all those amazing SF restaurants can add up - and the coffee shops after. That said, we&rsquo;ve also learned a thing or two in our years in SF. So take these tips from a #local. Here&rsquo;s how to NOT break the bank on your trip to the City by the Bay.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Use Public Transportation</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Even if you&rsquo;re not used to using public transportation in your home city, in SF you&rsquo;re going to want to get used to. The price difference is astounding. And in many instances, public transportation is often the more convenient option in the city (Just read our recent posts on the numerous <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/the-june-festivals-you-cannot-miss-in-sf/\">SF summer festivals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/sch-protips-for-parking-in-sf/\">#parking</a>). So if you packed light for your SF trip, we highly recommend taking the BART from the airport to SCH. It takes the same amount of time as driving, for a fraction of the cost. And when it comes to getting around the city, absolutely get a <a href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/transit/fares-passes/visitor-day-passes\">Muni Passport</a>. Muni is the general transportation system in the city (cable cars, light rail, buses) and a 3 or 7-day visitor pass could easily save you hundreds.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Check 4 Museum Freebies</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">While you might be tempted to go for the <a href=\"http://www.citypass.com/san-francisco\">CityPASS</a>, which offers discount admission to a bunch of SF attractions, we encourage you to check the individual prices of local attractions. You just might end up saving money by buying everything separately. For example, almost all of the museums in San Francisco offer free admission at least one day out of the week. Some are free 24/7, or half-price during certain hours. Here&rsquo;s a guide to the <a href=\"http://www.freemuseumday.org/sf.html\">museum freebies</a>.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Use the SCH Refillable Water Bottles</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We&rsquo;re also all about saving at SCH (and being healthy!), which is why we give all our guests complimentary refillable water bottles. We know how important it is to stay hydrated. But we also know that buying multiple bottles of water adds up - and pollutes. And in SF there are plenty of water fountains and places to refill your water bottle, so why not? #ProTip - drinking water is a great way to lower your restaurant bill.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Book Our Bed &amp; Breakfast Package</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. A good breakfast can keep you nourished throughout the day - and less prone to hunger pangs, which is why, considering that restaurant prices only get more expensive as the day goes on, it&rsquo;s especially important to be eating well in the mornings. Even better is that SCH gives you access to one of SF&rsquo;s best breakfasts for free when you book our bed and breakfast package.
