That leaves the small things 2 you. We&rsquo;ve got your back. Here&rsquo;s a handy packing list to make your Outside Lands experience a success.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cash</strong> &mdash; In this digital, debit, chip-reader world it&rsquo;s easy to forget the most basic engine of a music festival&rsquo;s economy: Cold. Hard. Ca$h. Having at least a little on you will make the day easier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Water</strong> &mdash; Your mom told us to remind you &mdash; stay hydrated. <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#outside-lands-save-20percent\">Have you heard of our water bottles</a>? If you don&rsquo;t bring water, you&rsquo;ll definitely end up buying some there. So why not save a few bucks? Especially when you can refill them at Outside Lands <a href=\"https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/eco-lands/\">water refilling stations</a>&hellip; #ThanksMom&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Sunscreen</strong> &mdash; The sun is giant ball of exploding gas and fire that wants to cook you. Put on some sunscreen and disrupt its agenda.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Rain Poncho</strong> &mdash; Easier to pack than an umbrella and, if you need to break it out, you&rsquo;ll still have both of your hands free for #selfies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Jacket</strong> &mdash; SF in the summer! No jackets required right? Well, maybe. The weather can get a little iffy around here, so pack a jacket. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Blanket</strong> &mdash; You can sit on it, snuggle in it, make a tent out of it, or even a cape. You figured all of this out as a child. We&rsquo;re just here to remind you about blankets and how much joy one will bring to your experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Phone Battery Charger</strong> &mdash; If you&rsquo;re a social media junkie or want to text with friends throughout the day, this could be the best packing decision you make. WARNING: You may have to hide it from the unprepared, low-battery hordes. No outlets. People get desperate. Stay safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Snacks</strong> &mdash; Clif bars, trail mix, an assorted plate of well-paired crackers and cheese. Perhaps some brie? You get the idea. The food at Outside Lands is great, so don&rsquo;t worry about the main course. But packing some snacks is a good idea 4 when the munchies attack.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Wipes</strong> &mdash; Even if there&rsquo;s not a child in sight for 10 miles, wipes can be a game changer. Clean up b4 you hit the food trucks, and, after you&rsquo;re done eating, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about sticky hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">#ProTip &mdash; Take <a href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/\">Muni</a>!
