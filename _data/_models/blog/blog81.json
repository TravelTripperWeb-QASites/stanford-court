However, considering that it is the anniversary of this important event, your guide 2 Haight-Ashbury is being served &ldquo;Summer of Love&rdquo; style. That said, here&rsquo;s your guide to those legendary spots from the Summer of Love that are still in existence. Click the links to see these spots on the map.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Haight-Ashbury Corner</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Easily the most recognizable landmark in the neighborhood, the street signs at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Haight+St,+San+Francisco,+CA,+USA/@37.7702022,-122.4480144,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580a8d32e7de9:0x6fc20be39a8f42c5!8m2!3d37.7712708!4d-122.4371246\">infamous corner</a> of Haight and Ashbury Streets are synonymous with the Summer of Love in SF. And that means a photo-op is an absolute must. Even more reason to visit is that Jimi Hendrix&rsquo; former apartment is just a few steps away. Just look for the Jimi mural, and you&rsquo;ve found his home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1497625517743\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_4233/media/2017-06-16-110229/guide-to-summer-of-love-haight-ashbury-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>photo by <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/cCq2WU\">Alex Adkins</a></em></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">710 Ashbury, aka The Grateful Dead House</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you continue down Haight Street, towards the Buena Vista Park, you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself in front of a legendary Victorian structure that was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/710+Haight+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94117,+USA/@37.7719457,-122.4362975,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580a60d3bd9d7:0xcfbd4f3ca7233333!8m2!3d37.7719457!4d-122.4341088\">home to Jerry Garcia</a> and crew during the Summer of Love. Unfortunately, The Dead house does have new owners, so there&rsquo;s no going in, but the owners aren&rsquo;t ones to complain about the numerous photo ops happening in front of their door.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Panhandle &amp; Hippie Hill</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A walk down hippie lane would not be complete without a trip to one of the many parks that the Summer of Love hippies converged upon during the summer of 1967. Both the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panhandle,+San+Francisco,+CA+94117,+USA/@37.7720504,-122.4545351,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580ad405811bb:0xd20d8aeb51b46264!8m2!3d37.7728515!4d-122.4460161\">Panhandle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hippie+Hill/@37.7699176,-122.4600756,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808587500069d877:0x50382a122acd3deb!8m2!3d37.7699176!4d-122.4578869\">Hippie Hill</a> in Golden Gate Park were two such popular spots.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1497625611041\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_4233/media/2017-06-16-110230/guide-to-summer-of-love-haight-ashbury-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>photo by <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/c7yQH\">Dawn Endico</a></em></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Evolutionary Rainbow</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thanks to the tireless efforts of the citizens of SF, this mural is still in existence. Painted by artist Yana Zegri during the Summer of Love, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+Cole/@37.7692523,-122.4530115,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80858753b68bc88b:0x98bb07f4216bc497!8m2!3d37.7692523!4d-122.4508228\">Evolutionary Rainbow</a> is not only a historic testament to the summer of &lsquo;67, but a psychedelic one as well. Unfortunately, in the 80s the mural was painted over, but after enough protesting by SF locals, Zegri was invited to repaint the mural. And today, it&rsquo;s been converted into a mosaic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Because it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>",
