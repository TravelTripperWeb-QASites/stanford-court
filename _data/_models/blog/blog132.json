  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to take a day trip to enjoy the fresh air and flavors of the fall harvest, check out Half Moon Bay. Located about an hour south of San Francisco, HMB is a half-moon shaped beach with a quaint downtown and lots of farms. Spend a day out of the city to see a different side of Northern California, and don&rsquo;t forget a sweater because the fog always rolls in.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Get there</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While there are <a href=\"https://www.rome2rio.com/s/San-Francisco/Half-Moon-Bay\">some transit options</a> to get to Half Moon Bay, via Bart and later CalTrain, transit is limited within Half Moon Bay if you want to leave downtown. If you have access to a car, there are <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/Half+Moon+Bay,+California,+USA/Stanford+Court+Hotel,+905+California+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94108,+USA/@37.4640507,-122.4322111,17.12z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f0ba50a19cb0b:0x5efd9cc835e79b54!2m2!1d-122.4285862!2d37.4635519!1m5!1m1!1s0x8085808c561d773d:0xb7afe5bc9f50d89c!2m2!1d-122.4095981!2d37.7915052?hl=en\">two scenic options</a> from SF: driving down the scenic 1, which runs along the Pacific Coast and offers great views. The other runs on the west side of the bay, and turns into a wooded thoroughfare through the hills, which is also beautiful. Roll down the windows and feel the cool, fresh air on either route, and be prepared for narrow lanes. As always, avoid rush hour.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Fall Pumpkin Patches</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Did you know Half Moon Bay is the pumpkin capital of the world? The locals have <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/travel/half-moon-bay-california-world-s-pumpkin-capital-1.9480228\">self-billed their little city as so</a>, anyway. The climate is perfect for many crops, and you&rsquo;ll see signs for local produce throughout HMB. For pumpkin patches in October, check out <a href=\"http://www.aratapumpkinfarm.com/?pid=home\">Arata&rsquo;s Pumpkin Farm</a>. Get lost in the 6-acre corn maze and take some pumpkin #selfies. <a href=\"http://www.farmerjohnspumpkins.com/products.htm\">Farmer John&rsquo;s</a> has many pumpkin varieties that are more than just your standard orange pumpkin.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Beaches</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you arrive from SR 1, you&rsquo;ll pass small beaches along the way. Check out whichever one suits you. Half Moon Bay State Beach is close to downtown and you can take in a usually foggy shoreline and ocean views. Parking is $10. You can opt for a free spot up the road on the side of the 1, which isn&rsquo;t an easy task because lanes are narrow, shoulders are sometimes nonexistent, and cars drive fast on the route. Proceed with caution. Also, beaches in Northern California are typically a little chilly, so bring a sweater so the cold ocean winds don&rsquo;t put a damper on the trip.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Explore Downtown</h4>\n<p>The historic Main Street of HMB has food, boutiques and more for visitors. For seafood, the variety spans from fish tacos to New England style fare. Another fun fact about HMB is that it boasts 70 wineries. On Main Street downtown, stop by <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/barterra-winery-half-moon-bay\">Barterra Winery</a> for a tasting. Check out the city&rsquo;s website for downtown options if you&rsquo;re looking to eat local fare produced by HMB farmers.</p>",
