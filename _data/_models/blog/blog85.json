  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco might not come across as the most patriotic city in America, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the City by the Bay doesn&rsquo;t celebrate. It just celebrates in its own special way. In SF, it&rsquo;s all about embracing the country&rsquo;s great outdoors, drinking its wine, and listening to its live music - and yes, watching its fireworks. That said, here are a few ways you can enjoy this Fourth of July weekend like a local.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Fillmore Jazz Festival</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Being that jazz is one of the greatest American contributions to music, it&rsquo;s only right that the <a href=\"http://angelisland.com/event/july-4th-2016/\">Fillmore Jazz Festival</a> is happening this July 4th weekend. Head down to Fillmore Street, between Jackson and Eddy for two days of live jazz, from old-school crooners to new wave-fusion across three different stages. Did we mention it&rsquo;s free?</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Watch the Fireworks from Angel Island</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">While you&rsquo;ll probably want to avoid the crowds during <a href=\"https://www.pier39.com/fourth-of-july/\">Pier 39&rsquo;s 4th of July celebration</a>, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you want to miss its fireworks. So do like the locals do and pack a late dinner and some California wine and ferry across to <a href=\"http://angelisland.com/\">Angel Island</a> on the 4th. This way you&rsquo;ll get to see the show from a whole different angle - and with the city in the background. And if you&rsquo;re not into planning, Angel Island is also offering a <a href=\"http://angelisland.com/event/july-4th-2016/\">buffet and ferry service</a> for the event.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Marin County Fair</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; to get real Americana this July 4th, the <a href=\"https://www.marinfair.org/\">Marin County Fair</a> is just the ticket. Held just across the Bay in San Rafael, the Marin County Fair is just that - a good ol&rsquo; fashioned county fair. Here you&rsquo;ll find numerous carnival rides on the Midway, like the Cliffhanger and the Tilt-A-Whirl, as well as nightly concerts, and plenty of delicious fair food. And each night of the fair there&rsquo;s a fireworks show set over the water, making for a spectacular end to the night.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Music @ Golden Gate Park</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This might be the most patriotic of SF&rsquo;s July 4th events. Set in the iconic Golden Gate Park, the <a href=\"http://goldengateparkband.org/\">Golden Gate Band</a> is making a special performance for the July 4th, featuring patriotic and American music. The music starts at 1 p.m. on the park&rsquo;s bandstand in the music concourse. Pack a picnic! And if you can&rsquo;t make it on Tuesday, there will still be the Golden Gate Band&rsquo;s usual&nbsp; Sunday performance on July 2, 2017. This week&rsquo;s theme is Latin American music.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stern Grove Festival</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The <a href=\"https://www.sterngrove.org/\">Stern Grove Festival</a> is already in full swing, and this Fourth of July Weekend, there&rsquo;s an especially good concert coming up. On Sunday, July 2, 2017, at 2 p.m., it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.sterngrove.org/2017-concerts/#july-2\">Fantastic Negrito along with Nicki Bluhm &amp; The Gramblers.</a> Considering that Fantastic Negrito just won the Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album, this is one show we won&rsquo;t be missing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>"
