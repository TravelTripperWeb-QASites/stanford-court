  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here at SCH, we like our wine - and we like good wine, which is to be expected considering we&rsquo;re so close to Napa and Sonoma Valley. And while we don&rsquo;t mean to get all #SnobHill about it, Nob Hill does have some of the best wine bars in SF. Fortunately, many of the wine bars in the neighborhood aren&rsquo;t snobby at all - and they&rsquo;re reasonably priced, which is right up <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">our alley</a>. That said, here is our list of the 5 best wine bars the neighborhood has to offer.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.robberbaronsf.com/\">Robberbaron</a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">2032 Polk Street</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.robberbaronsf.com/\">Robberbaron</a> is elegant and sleek with a knowledgeable and courteous staff. The wine selection is small but carefully selected and glasses range in price from $10-15. Check out the specials and if you&rsquo;re there on a Wednesday, you&rsquo;re in luck: there&rsquo;s free charcuterie from 6:30 to 8 p.m. #WineDownWednesday anyone?</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/napaology/\">The Lab by Napaology</a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">930 Bush Street</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This techie-themed casual bistro is affordable and #SoSF. The periodic table of elements and chalkboards bring you back to science class, and cocktails are served in beakers. Really, there&rsquo;s no other place like it. The Lab is closed Monday and Tuesday, but you can always make up for lost time on the weekends.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.ameliewinebar.com/\">Amelie</a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1754 Polk Street</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Amelie has perhaps the most extensive wine selection in Nob Hill. The lounge-like atmosphere and French-inspired finger food go great with a glass of wine after a long day, while its lighting sets that perfect date mood. Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to take a date, Amelie is good #justbecause. However, this is a busy spot even on weekdays, so make sure to get there before 7 to beat the crowds.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://sfpourhouse.com/\">The Pour House</a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1327 Polk Street</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The Pour House is one of our favorites. It&rsquo;s hella laid back with zero pretension. This cute, casual spot offers $12 flights and even lets you order food to be delivered directly to the bar. There&rsquo;s often live, local music and they stay open late. Wine glasses start at $6 and if you check-in on Yelp! there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ll get 2 free samples. This is a perfect place for people new to wine who want a comfortable atmosphere to explore their options.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.cafemeuse.com/cq0osrsmeu4wnpsgy0n1vola4rf0db\">Cafe Meuse</a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1400 Pacific Avenue</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Easily the most European of the bunch, Cafe Meuse has a carefully-selected wine list from small production batches near and far. It&rsquo;s classy and cozy at the same time, something that&rsquo;s no easy feat - anywhere. Here you can also find some great small plates to compliment the wine list, all at moderate prices, making Cafe Meuse a solid go-to spot in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>"
