  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love is well-underway, and we&rsquo;ve been celebrating here at Stanford Court Hotel ever since the de Young Museum opened their fabulous exhibition, &ldquo;The Summer of Love Experience: Art, Fashion, and Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll&rdquo; back in April (If you&rsquo;re interested in getting a #sneakpeek, read more about it in our recent blog post <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/a-sch-sneakpeek-the-summer-of-love-experience/\">here</a>). But the truth of the matter is, we only have one more month left in the Summer of Love (and only one more month of our hella amazing <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">promotion</a>), which is why we&rsquo;d like to leave you with something that will last long after the anniversary comes to a close - a SCH curated playlist of the ultimate Summer of Love songs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Listen to them whenever you&rsquo;re feeling nostalgic about the City by the Bay, or even better enjoy them during a Summer-of-Love-themed walking tour of the Haight-Ashbury. We even recommended some spots <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/the-sch-guide-2-the-summer-of-love-in-the-haight-ashbury/\">on the blog</a>. Without further ado, here&rsquo;s your Summer of Love playlist:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco - Scott McKenzie</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This is the song that started it all - the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6vcNJUWtUPB0hKC6VbZriY\">accidental Summer of Love ballad</a> that called everyone to the City by the Bay. Listen to it to get in the Summer of Love mood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">White Rabbit - Jefferson Airplane</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">One of the songs most associated with the hippie movement, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4vpeKl0vMGdAXpZiQB2Dtd\">White Rabbit</a> by Grace Slick and crew is all about &ldquo;Turn on, tune in, and drop out.&rdquo; Listen to it at <a href=\"http://magnoliabrewing.com/haight/\">Magnolia</a>, a popular brewery located in the same building as the restaurant of SF Summer of Love icon Magnolia Thunderpussy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">California Dreamin&rsquo; - The Mamas &amp; The Papas</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Just plain classic. Listen to this beloved track by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4s6LhHAV5SEsOV0lC2tjvJ\">The Mamas &amp; The Papas</a> when planning your trip to San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Let&rsquo;s Live for Today - The Grass Roots</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Talk about a song that embodies the Summer of Love mentality. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2IobDyMywYgrJAdLpRvqvT\">Let&rsquo;s Live for Today</a>&rdquo; is an anthem for the moment and for love - and a perfect companion for your tour of the Haight-Ashbury.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Incense and Peppermints - Strawberry Alarm Clock</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">With its iconic psychedelic sound, \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/16iApoNZYaN6gbMtRRVV6B\">Incense and Peppermints\"</a> immediately transports you back to 1967 from the first few seconds of the track. This is a must on your Summer of Love playlist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Naturally, this once-SF local and classic rock icon has to make the list. And what better way than with his legendary <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0wJoRiX5K5BxlqZTolB2LD\">first track</a> on his debut album, <em>Are You Experienced?</em> Stop by his former residence in the Haight-Ashbury at 1524A Haight St.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Piece of My Heart - Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Another 60s classic, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1xKQbqQtQWrtQS47fUJBtl\">Piece of My Heart</a>&rdquo; is often credited to Janis Joplin. However, she recorded it first with Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company #nowyouknow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">New Potato Caboose - The Grateful Dead</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">No San Francisco Summer of Love piece is complete without a nod to The Dead. Their style of music, aka jam band, was a defining part of the SF sound and the music scene in general. Although it&rsquo;s hard to categorize the Grateful Dead, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4M8lFLTCraQ2J0mg41PTgj\">New Potato Caboose</a> is a good place to start.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sunshine Superman - Donovan</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Another iconic figure of the period, Donovan was a regular on the California music circuit. and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4RGxUjaCmVtD30pIhtEi7w\">Sunshine Superman</a>&rdquo; is one of his best songs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">You&rsquo;re Gonna Miss Me - 13th Floor Elevators</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&rsquo;s a #bonus gem. Possibly one of the lesser-known bands on this list, the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2FSIX7BtCaGdx04vof4LBt\">13th Floor Elevators</a> were an influential part of the psychedelic rock scene. Listen for their signature sound - a jug - &nbsp;on this track.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - Our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">Summer of Love special</a> runs through August 20. Get a special rate at Stanford Court Hotel, VIP tickets to &ldquo;The Summer of Love Experience&rdquo; at the de Young Museum, and plenty more.</em></p>"
