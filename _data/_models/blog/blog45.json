However, we know sometimes those platters can get a bit pricey so we&rsquo;ve narrowed our list down to some great happy hours that tame that seafood craving without breaking the bank. Not to mention, its one of the best ways to spend your time in the San Francisco. Here are the city&rsquo;s prime spots for $1 oysters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ferryplazaseafood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ferry Seafood Building</a>: This restaurant has only recently become known for their fantastic seafood including their oysters.
