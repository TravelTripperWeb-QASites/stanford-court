	"long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Through May 29, 2017 @ the San Francisco Legion of Honor</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you think you&rsquo;ve seen Monet, think again. The latest exhibition, &ldquo;Monet: The Early Years&rdquo; shows the artist in a completely new light. A collaboration between the San Francisco Fine Art Museums and the Kimball Fine Art Museum of Fort Worth (Texas), &ldquo;<a href=\"http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/monet-early-years\">Monet: The Early Years</a>&rdquo; is a rare glimpse into the young artist&rsquo;s development and experimentation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Yet neither is the collection a compilation of an unseasoned artist finding his way. Already a young master, the collection demonstrates how Monet almost single-handedly defined Impressionism, the style for which he was so famous for. The collection begins with the artist&rsquo;s earliest work, starting at age 17, and travels through a variety of subjects, with daring brushstrokes and risk-taking techniques as the young master fulfills his need to paint.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_2164/media/2017-03-27-105621/monet-early-years-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">With pieces from the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., this is one of the most complete collection - as well as one of the most distinct curations of Monet&rsquo;s work. Some of the most unique pieces include, &ldquo;The Green Wave&rdquo; (1866), a uncharacteristically dark piece out of Monet&rsquo;s usually bright repertoire. There&rsquo;s also La Porte d&rsquo;Amont, &Eacute;tretat&rdquo; (1868) which is quite dramatic in comparison to his better known work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_2164/media/2017-03-27-105621/monet-early-years-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Nevertheless, viewers will also see some more recognizable works, such as &ldquo;Magpie&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt,&rdquo; both showcasing the artist&rsquo;s path towards Impressionism. For both seasoned veterans and newcomers to Moent, this highly-acclaimed exhibit does not disappoint. <br /><br />&ldquo;Monet: The Early Years&rdquo; runs through May 29, 2017 at the San Francisco Legion of Honor. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Like what you&rsquo;re reading?
