	"long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Polk Street gets pegged for its bars and nightlife scene, because, well, there are quite a few. But it&rsquo;s also got some of the coolest shops in the Nob Hill - Russian Hill area. That said, do yourself a favor and take a stroll during the day - and stay into the night. It&rsquo;s only a short walk from Stanford Court Hotel. Here are some spots that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss along Nob Hill&rsquo;s most popular avenue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Swan Oyster Depot</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.sfswanoysterdepot.com/\">Swan Oyster Depot</a> has been around for over 100 years. Let that sink in. It&rsquo;s a Polk Street legend, and it may very well be the best seafood you eat in your life. Although this is definitely a local dive, the staff is always friendly and welcoming, tourist or not. When you finally get seated, order a bowl of chowder and slurp down some oysters. The crab salad is also phenomenal. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bob's Donut &amp; Pastry</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Another Polk Street classic, <a href=\"http://www.moltecose.com/\">Bob&rsquo;s Donut &amp; Pastry</a> prides itself on being one of the few remaining independent donut shops around. Being open 24 hours a day, it also has quite the following very late night. But the real clincher at Bob&rsquo;s is that the donuts are HUGE. Think the size of your head. Of course, they do have normal-sized donuts, but that would kill all the fun at 4 a.m., right? #LocalTip: Get there around 10-11 for donuts fresh out of the fryer. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if there&rsquo;s a line, especially if it&rsquo;s Saturday night.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Belle Cose &amp; Molte Cose</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A pair of women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s vintage boutiques, <a href=\"http://www.moltecose.com/\">Belle Cose and Molte Cose</a> make shopping fun again. These adorable boutiques also have some seriously good finds that are curated better than most boutiques, without losing that garage sale-treasure hunt charm. Here you&rsquo;ll find quality vintage clothes from the 1940-50s, as well as trinkets and even lingerie.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Smoke Signals</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">At Smoke Signals, print is alive and well. With over 2,000 publications from all over the world, this news stand is sure to have the magazine or newspaper you&rsquo;re looking for. However, take some time to peruse the rack. It&rsquo;s easy to miss some quality publications upon first glance.&nbsp; And if happen to be a smoker, this is one of the few places you find those hard-to-find cigarettes you always crave. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Royal Oak</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A guide about Polk Street wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a nod to this dive bar. A Polk mainstay since 1975, the irony is that Royal Oak is hit or miss - not because of the quality of bar or drinks, but because even locals don&rsquo;t know when it will be open or not. Either way, it&rsquo;s worth it to try your luck and throw a few back in this Victorian-style bar, complete with velvet couches and Tiffany lamps.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>photo by Eric <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2qsjKJ\">Heath</a></em></p>",
