At Stanford Court we believe the best way to get in the spirit of the holidays is to attend the Union Square Tree Lighting. Here are some details about this year&rsquo;s event:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2016 Union Square Tree Lighting</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Macy&rsquo;s 27th Annual Great Tree Lighting Ceremony</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Union Square | San Francisco</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Saturday, November 25, 2016 &ndash; 6pm</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All are invited to this free event! The Macy&rsquo;s 27th Annual Tree Lighting will take place in Union Square Park between Sutter and Post and Geary and Stockton Streets, right across from the front of Macy&rsquo;s. The beautiful and reusable tree will be decorated with more than 33,000 twinkling energy-efficient LED lights and 1,100 shining ornaments.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For the best viewing location, stop by Union Square early to stake out your spot. One tip is to manage to get a spot at the Cheesecake Factory &ndash; top of Macy&rsquo;s which looks down over Union Square. They have outdoor dining with heat lamps and the view to the ice rink and skaters is spectacular.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ceremony is expected to begin at 6pm and the tree is scheduled to be lit at 6:40pm.</p>",
