  "long_description": "<p>We&rsquo;re all about eating clean in the neighborhood. But we&rsquo;re also all about eating well, aka delicious. The two don&rsquo;t always coincide. We&rsquo;re here to tell you that they can - and they do in SF. That said, here are favorite spots for clean eating in SF:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Blue Barn</strong></p>\n<p>Blue Barn Gourmet is one of those places where you can eat clean without sacrificing any flavor. It&rsquo;s also one of the places you can take any friends and family that haven&rsquo;t jumped on the CLEAN bandwagon. While <a href=\"http://www.bluebarngourmet.com/\">Blue Barn</a> believes in all-natural and sustainable ingredients, it&rsquo;s not so health freak that it prohibits fresh baked bread (granted, Blue Barn&rsquo;s bread is organic and fresh-baked). The salads are top-notch at this Russian Hill spot, but the sandwiches don&rsquo;t disappoint either. In the Marina? Check out their Chestnut Street location and second location they opened up around the corner on Steiner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Plant Cafe Organic</strong></p>\n<p>At The Plant, you can feel good about what you&rsquo;re eating - and so can your wallet. Although SF restaurants have the rep of being overpriced (and even more so the healthy ones), <a href=\"http://theplantcafe.com/location/pier-3\">The Plant</a> is the reasonable one in the sea of green. It&rsquo;s also casual and great for a quick meal (Go for The Plant burger!) While there are quite a few The Plant locations throughout the City by the Bay, the location on Pier 3 at the Embarcadero is the one to visit. Not only will you have The Plant Cafe&rsquo;s phenomenal selection of all organic meals, but you&rsquo;ll also get some great views of the water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Gracias Madre</strong></p>\n<p>Gracias Madre is one place that will make you think twice about vegan food. It will also make you think twice about conventional Mexican food. <a href=\"http://gracias-madre.com/index.html\">Gracias Madre</a> is turning heads, courtesy of its all-vegan Mexican menu. Frankly, any vegan restaurant that can win over the stomach of a non-vegan is worth trying. The real question is, &ldquo;Who says Mexican food can&rsquo;t be vegan?&rdquo;.Go for the gorditas and the tostadas. And make sure you get an order of the black beans. They&rsquo;re to die for.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Urban Remedy</strong></p>\n<p>City life got you down? <a href=\"https://urbanremedy.com/\">Urban Remedy</a> is your solution. These local eateries not only serve up clean food, but they also do it fast. Urban Remedy has healthy food to-go and for delivery, which frankly is hard to find, even if this is SF. And while we may be all about the slow food movement, it is also nice to be able to grab something quick without regretting it later, especially when you&rsquo;re traveling. That said, Urban Remedy is perfect to take along during your sight-seeing around the city. You can even grab a picnic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Little Gem</strong></p>\n<p>For those of you looking for gluten-free and dairy-free, <a href=\"http://www.littlegem.restaurant/\">Little Gem</a> is your dream come true. Here you can eat guilt-free, and delicious. Little Gem&rsquo;s menu focuses on fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced locally from California farms, while still drawing inspiration from international cuisine and creating elegant presentations. &nbsp;We love their almond + quinoa pancakes with blueberries and vanilla coconut cream. Sounds good, right?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em>Committed to a healthy lifestyle? SCH is too! Work out at our 24-hour fitness center, or rent one of our bikes and explore SF. And don't forget to take advantage of our water bottles and water-bottle refilling stations throughout the hotel. <br /></em></p>"
