  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Midtown Manhattan is packed with landmarks and must-see sights, but not many command the same admiration from New Yorkers and tourists alike - Grand Central Terminal does. And what&rsquo;s not to love about it? A time capsule in itself, the building has been standing since 1913, it&rsquo;s the busiest and biggest train terminal in the world, and it&rsquo;s downright beautiful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you&rsquo;re waiting for a train or you&rsquo;re just meeting someone who&rsquo;s a tad late, Grand Central will keep you busy, entertained and well fed. Think of it as a small city within a city. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.grandcentralterminal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GCT_Directory2017_Exploration_22x28_Rolling-Kiosk_0504.pdf\">Grand Central&rsquo;s map</a> and explore a new site, grab a bite or overdose in architectural icons next time you&rsquo;re there. Here are our top recommendations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.oysterbarny.com/\">Oyster Bar &amp; Restaurant</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a place has been open since 1913 and is still going strong, you can be sure they&rsquo;re doing something right. Believe it or not, the specialty of the house are oysters! Fresh seafood, an extensive wine list and a lively atmosphere are also a big draw. We recommend visiting for Happy Hour.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Location<br /></strong>Dining Concourse (lower level), in front of ramps to the Main Concourse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.thecampbellnyc.com/\">The Campbell Bar</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If fine dining and cocktails are right up your alley, head to the historic Campbell Bar. This corner of Grand Central brings back the decor and sophistication of the &lsquo;30s, while maintaining an <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/eat-and-drink/\">air of exclusivity reminiscent of the Royalton Hotel. </a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Location<br /></strong>Balcony Level, West side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/grand-central-market/\">Grand Central Market</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Local produce and gourmet food from 13 carefully selected vendors will keep your belly satisfied. Even if you&rsquo;ve been there a hundred times, seasonal foods will keep you guessing. This is the ideal location if you&rsquo;re after some freshly baked bread, a huge cheese selection and high-quality products to cook at home or give to a friend.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Location<br /></strong>Main Concourse, accessible from Lexington Avenue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.nytransitmuseum.org/visit/\">New York Transit Museum Annex and Store</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rotating exhibits, seasonal events, such as the Annual Holiday Train Show, and tidbits of history await to those who visit. There&rsquo;s also a store perfect to buy trinkets for that train lover in your life (or yourself).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Location<br /></strong>Main Concourse in the Shuttle Passage, next to the Station Masters&rsquo; Office.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.grandcentralterminal.com/events/\">Events at Vanderbilt Hall</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vanderbilt Hall is synonym of grandeur - one need only look up at the five stunning chandeliers hanging over the terminal&rsquo;s main event hall. Check out the calendar of events to find out what&rsquo;s happening - product launches are particularly cool!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Location<br /></strong>Main Concourse, across from Great Northern Food Hall and accessible from 42nd St</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Manhattanites and frequent travelers to New York already know that Grand Central houses much more than our top picks. Next time you&rsquo;re visiting <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/rooms-and-suites/\">the Royalton</a>, take the<a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/location/\"> four-block walk to Grand Central</a> and rediscover this landmark - it never ceases to amaze.</p>",
