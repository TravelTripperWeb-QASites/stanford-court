TechCrunch&rsquo;s annual celebration of the best in tech turns 10 this year, with some pretty impressive innovators vying for their very own Crunchie. While we&rsquo;re in favor of anything that can be downloaded to our phones, there are some nominees that stand out. Here are our some of the coolest innovations up for a Crunchie:</p>\n<p><strong>SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing</strong></p>\n<p>Every day we the people get closer to riding in a spaceship. And for that we have Elon Musk to thank. This time it&rsquo;s Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX that is up for a Crunchie after its 2016 landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/08/spacex-just-landed-a-rocket-on-a-drone-ship-for-the-first-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon 9 on a drone</a>. The more successful landings, the closer SpaceX will get to reusing rockets for space travel &ndash; and maybe taking us along with them.</p>\n<p><strong>CRISPR</strong></p>\n<p>Easily the most jaw-dropping innovation at the Crunchies &ndash; and of the century &mdash; is<a href=\"http://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-crispr-cas9\" target=\"_blank\"> CRISPR</a>, which could end up saving the world. Discovered by scientists at both Berkeley and MIT, CRISPR has the ability to alter one&rsquo;s genetic code by finding where mutations, such as viruses and cancer, lie and erasing them from the DNA sequence. If it sounds complicated, it is. And there&rsquo;s still loads more research to be done. Nevertheless, the discovery has been made.</p>\n<p><strong>Snapchat Spectacles</strong></p>\n<p>Ever feel like you completely killed the moment the minute you tried to snapchat a story? We&rsquo;ve all been there. And apparently so have the makers of Snapchat, which is why they rolled out the <a href=\"https://www.spectacles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Snapchat Spectacles</a>, so you can record everything you see from behind your sunglasses. We can&rsquo;t decide whether it&rsquo;s cool or creepy, but for the sake of the Crunchies we&rsquo;ll say cool.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>That said, the Crunchies will not be televised. They will be streamed. However, if you&rsquo;re at Stanford Court on February 6, you could also just go see them live. This is an award show they actually let you attend. And Chelsea Peretti is hosting, so it&rsquo;s sure to be entertaining.</p>\n<p>Like what you&rsquo;re reading? Give us a like on Facebook.</p>"
