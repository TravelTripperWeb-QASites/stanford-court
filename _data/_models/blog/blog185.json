  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The reliable fog and chilly temperatures of San Francisco sometimes leaves locals and visitors craving a little piece of home, usually in the form of a piping hot dish of high-calorie food. True to SF fashion, the comfort food in our city is often done-up with a little something special; a fresh take on the ordinary.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese <em>at Mac Daddy in Potrero Hill</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">This unassuming Potrero Hill spot is dedicated to the beloved dish of macaroni and cheese. The side item becomes the main event at <a href=\"http://www.macdaddysf.com/\">Mac Daddy</a>, and the truffle mac &amp; cheese is devilishly tasty with shiitake mushrooms, thyme, rich truffle oil and truffle brie cheese. There&rsquo;s also South West and pizza inspired takes on the old classic, available to be prepared gluten-free. Mac Daddy is a small joint located in Potrero Hill with 10 bar seats and two small tables. Cozy up to the bar and enjoy a filling order of mac &amp; cheese.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Dr. Pepper Braised Short Ribs<em> at The Front Porch in Bernal Heights</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">It was hard to decide what to recommend from here -- with crawfish hush puppies, chicken &amp; waffles and vegan etouffee, choices on the menu are both tempting and filling. The Dr. Pepper short ribs are sweet, savory, and manage to have that smokey, mesquite bbq taste from back home. Enjoy Creole and Cajun-inspired down home cookin&rsquo; at <a href=\"http://thefrontporchsf.com/\">The Front Porch.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Grilled Pork Chops with Bourbon Demi <em>at Aliment in Nob Hill</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Most of us can&rsquo;t eat a pork chop without applesauce, but the pork chops at <a href=\"http://www.alimentsf.com/\">Aliment</a> makes the sweet apple a distraction. The dish comes complete with mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans and a bourbon demi glaze. Aliment is just a block from <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/\">Stanford Court Hotel</a> on Bush Street and serves modern American fare -- for an appetizer, try the steamed mussels with chorizo.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Butternut Squash Lasagna <em>at Marcella&rsquo;s Lasagneria in the Dog Patch</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Okay, we know that butternut squash lasagna isn&rsquo;t anything new, but the handmade lasagna at <a href=\"http://www.marcellaslasagneria.com/menu.html\">Marcella&rsquo;s</a> is so perfectly tasty we couldn&rsquo;t leave it off the list. The busy lunch spot (open &lsquo;til 4:30, closed weekends) always hits the spot, with thin lasagnas only your nonna knows how to make. Family operated since the 1980s.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Grilled Cheese &aacute; la Jalape&ntilde;o Popper <em>at The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen in S. Beach</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Don&rsquo;t knock it &lsquo;til you try it -- made with goat cheese, mozzarella, apricot and jalape&ntilde;o relish on sourdough, there is something wildly tasty about this sandwich. If spicy isn&rsquo;t your deal, there&rsquo;s other options that deliver. The very simple Mousetrap Grilled Cheese made with a medley of complimentary cheeses is sometimes all you need for that taste of home.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Tater Tot Nachos <em>at Tacorea in Nob Hill</em></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Tacorea is Mexican and Korean fare, but we&rsquo;re not sure who the parents of the Tater Tot Nachos are. Either way, they&rsquo;re simply divine if you&rsquo;re looking to indulge in a childhood favorite. Pick a meat (we suggest the Bulgogi Asada) and enjoy all the Mexican toppings of guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, crema, and cotija cheese. Also try a burrito with kimchi if you&rsquo;re jonesing for an excellent culinary mix of two countries known for flavorful dishes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">--&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-04db5fac-6148-07ce-5116-9648bfdf9a63\">Ready to book with us?
