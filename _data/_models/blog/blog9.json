  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A derelict freight line, turned urban park, turned top attraction, the High Line sees thousands of tourists come and go every day; some love it, others walk away unimpressed. A Manhattanite, however, knows that only those with patience and keen eyes will understand what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Wonders of Nature</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Long and slow commutes, crowds 24/7, temperamental printers and hefty prices everywhere are only a handful of the reasons why New Yorkers need to get away. With Central Park enclosed by skyscrapers, the effect can be claustrophobic. At the High Line, however, one gets a sense of infinity when looking over at the Hudson River, especially at sunset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though weather be foul, New York has four well-defined seasons - and that translates to different landscapes every month, every year. What&rsquo;s unique about this particular piece of land is that perennial and native plants are the stars of the party.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1518565550128\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" width=\"749\" height=\"497\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/large_royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/medium_royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/small_royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/xsmall_royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184546/thumb_royalton-high-line-art.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Art Year-Round</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Years ago, Chelsea earned the title as an artsy and hip neighborhood. Today, it continues to attract innovative artists eager to share their vision in an urban landscape. Sculptures, paintings and installations rotate throughout the year to create an ever-changing display of contemporary and conceptual art.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To learn what&rsquo;s happening in the High Line&rsquo;s art scene, visit the <a href=\"http://art.thehighline.org/\">High Line Art website</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1518565600100\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" width=\"751\" height=\"563\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/large_royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/medium_royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/small_royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/xsmall_royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_12233/media/2018-02-13-184636/thumb_royalton-high-line-wildlife.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Unexpected Wildlife</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With shrubs, flowers and trees sprouting left, right and center, animals have found nooks and crannies to call home. Be it January or August, the High Line never stops seeing its wild guests or migratory species.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pay close attention and you might see peregrine falcons, honeybees, monarch butterflies and many other species zooming around the entire park. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.thehighline.org/activities/tour-high-line-as-habitat\">wildlife tours</a> offered from May through September.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next time you&rsquo;re in need of a respite from life, your boss or the in-laws, pamper yourself with a stay at the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a> and take a walk along the High Line, but remember to slow down and smell the flowers. The beauty isn&rsquo;t in the selfie but in the details that inject life into this unique New York attraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
