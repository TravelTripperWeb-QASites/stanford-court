  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s no secret that we love our pets at SCH. After all, SCH is 100% pet-friendly. Four-legged friends are always invited - and pampered like our guests. Upon arrival we shower your pet with a goodie bag, complete with chew toys and treats (and poop bags for your convenience). Our dog-friendly rooms also come stocked with food, water, and a plush bed all for your pet. That&rsquo;s all inside Stanford Court. Here&rsquo;s what to do when you get outside in SF with your pet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Huntington Park</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Just a block from Stanford Court Hotel, this is one of our favorite pet-friendly spots in the city. In fact, that&rsquo;s one of the things that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Huntington+Park/@37.7921856,-122.4143624,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8085808d679987cd:0x4e30644c4c64fced!8m2!3d37.7921814!4d-122.4121737\">Huntington Park</a> is known for. With its stunning views of Grace Cathedral and SF from a top one of the neighborhood&rsquo;s many hills, Huntington Park makes for a perfect morning or afternoon for both pet and owner. Lounge in the grass while the pooch runs free.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Pour House</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Four-legged friends + happy hour makes us some happy campers. And this Nob Hill establishment is all about bringing your dog to happy hour. That&rsquo;s why we like <a href=\"http://sfpourhouse.com/\">The Pour House</a>. This local wine bar has a great selection of California wines and a few international favorites as well, along with nightly entertainment. Even better is that it&rsquo;s in the SCH neighborhood.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Crissy Field</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Hands down, this is the ultimate dog park in San Francisco. Set on the beach with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge, <a href=\"http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/crissy-field.html\">Crissy Field</a> is the mecca of off-leash dog parks in the City by the Bay. Adding to its appeal, there are trails for both walking and biking, picnic tables, and tidal marsh overlooks. Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your doggie bags from SCH, fellow pet owners will thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Hops &amp; Hominy</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you&rsquo;ve worked up an appetite after being out and about all day with the pooch, head to <a href=\"http://www.hopsandhominy.com/\">Hops &amp; Hominy</a> in Union Square. Not only are there a ton of beers on tap (and local, too!), there&rsquo;s some seriously good Southern comfort food to accompany it. Here you and Fido can chill out on the patio overlooking the bay before making the short walk back to SCH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mountain Lake</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">One of the best spots in the city to relax, <a href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/places/mountain-lake\">Mountain Lake</a> is a clear favorite for both owners and pets alike. With plenty of open spaces, trails for running, and a peaceful lake as well, this dog park covers all the bases. The good thing is that, although it is popular, it&rsquo;s spacious enough that it doesn&rsquo;t get overcrowded. And it&rsquo;s also great for the kids due to its newly renovated playground.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</em></p>"
