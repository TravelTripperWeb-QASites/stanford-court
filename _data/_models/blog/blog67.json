  "long_description": "<p>If you&rsquo;re going to San Francisco...be sure to wear some flowers in your hair - and book our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">Summer of Love package</a>.</p>\n<p>In honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, SCH is offering a pretty far out special. Until August 20, guests can get overnight accommodations in a standard or deluxe room at our high-tech hotel, 2 VIP tickets to the &ldquo;Summer of Love Experience: Art, Fashion, &amp; Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll&rdquo; @ the de Young Museum, a hippie tote bag filled with goodies (aka retro sunglasses and tattoos) and a map of SF&rsquo;s historic Summer of Love spots, as well as famous hangouts of the Beat Generation.</p>\n<p>At the de Young Museum you&rsquo;ll go back in time with interactive music, light shows, photographs, posters, and original clothing, all which make up part of the 300 cultural artifacts that will be on display. Even more interesting is that the museum has taken a distinctly &ldquo;Only in San Francisco&rdquo; approach, highlighting the important role that only the City by the Bay could play in a time of such social upheaval. <br /><br />Once you&rsquo;ve got a good background on the Summer of Love from the de Young Museum, you&rsquo;ll get out and actually see the places that were mentioned in the exhibit. SCH has put together an informative map of some of the most iconic spots made famous during the hippie movement. Think the corner of Haight-Ashbury, Buena Vista Park, Janis Joplin&rsquo;s pink apartment, and of course, Golden Gate Park. That said, don&rsquo;t forget to don your sunglasses! Our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">Summer of Love special</a> runs through August 20.&nbsp; <br /><br /><em>Stay dates are from April 8 to August 20. Package must be booked a minimum of 48 hours prior to arrival. Subject to availability, cannot be combined with other promotions or discounts; not applicable to groups. Additional person charge is $20.00/person and based on max capacity of room type.</em></p>"
