New York City was the centerpiece of this dramatic change. The most successful businessmen of that era came from nothing and, today, their legacy lives on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Cornelius Vanderbilt</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ship magnate, turned railroad titan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, &ldquo;The Commodore,&rdquo; was at one point the richest man in the United States. His ability to predict the shift from ships to railroads in the transportation industry, paired with his cool and strategic mind, were the key to his success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NYC Legacy</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Did you know that Grand Central Terminal is deeply linked to Vanderbilt? Architectural details include oak leaves and acorns, which are symbols of the Vanderbilt family, can be seen throughout the station and the famous Vanderbilt Hall. He also purchased the land where the terminal now sits and the surrounding neighborhood is home to Vanderbilt Avenue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want more proof of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s wealth, head to Central Park. The gates of the Conservatory Garden are the same gates that once surrounded one of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s mansions in New York. Pay a visit to The Met Fifth Avenue to see many lavish artifacts that belonged to the Vanderbilts, the most famous is the intricate Vanderbilt mantelpiece made of marble, mosaic, oak, and cast iron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">John D. Rockefeller</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Initially the owner of a struggling oil refinery in Cleveland, Ohio, John D. Rockefeller worked incredibly hard to expand his company by standardizing the quality of kerosene, leading to the name Standard Oil Company. He skillfully created a monopoly and soon became the richest and most powerful man in the country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NYC Legacy</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The construction of Rockefeller Center began in 1931 as a way to create a city within New York City and generate jobs during the Great Depression. The Rockefeller University, initially the Rockefeller Institute, started as the first biomedical research institution in the country. The Rockefeller family has also been involved in the MoMA, which now sits on the site of Rockefeller&rsquo;s former home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Carnegie</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joining the ranks of Vanderbilt and Rockefeller, &ldquo;The King of Steel,&rdquo; Andrew Carnegie was groomed for business by Thomas Scott. He shot to fame by building the first steel bridge that crossed the Mississippi River. After this success, he built a major steel plant to supply the United States with steel for construction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NYC Legacy</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carnegie became an avid philanthropist who created many foundations to support education science and the arts. Carnegie Hall opened in 1891 and Tchaikovsky played at the inaugural concert gala. After 127 years, this concert hall remains one of the best in the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carnegie&rsquo;s New York home was an innovative and grand property that still exists today. The former mansion is now a landmark that has been housing the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum since 1976.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Follow the Royalton New York Hotel blog to read part two of the fascinating history of New York&rsquo;s most influential businessmen!</p>",
