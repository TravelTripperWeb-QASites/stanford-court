	"long_description": "<p><strong><em>through August 5 @ the SHN Orpheum Theater</em></strong></p>\n<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the past two years, the musical Hamilton has taken America by storm. And now it&rsquo;s finally making its way to San Francisco. Nominated for a record-breaking 16 nominations at the 2016 Tony Awards, Hamilton won 11 Tonys, including &ldquo;Best Musical.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also won the Grammy for &ldquo;Best Musical Theater Album&rdquo; and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was a game-changer on Broadway, presenting an overlooked historical anecdote in a radical way with numerous parallels to the cultural and political climate. <br /><br />Written by Lin Manuel Miranda, of Tony award-winning, In the Heights, Hamilton is &ldquo;the story of America then, as told by America now.&rdquo; Based on the biography by Ron Chernow, the musical&nbsp; chronicles the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, through spoken word poetry and hip-hop beats, all performed by a multi-racial and multi-gendered cast. <br /><br />You don&rsquo;t have to be a historian or scholar to see why this was such a game-changer on Broadway, yet Hamilton also draws light on some lesser known facts about the country&rsquo;s first Secretary of the Treasury. Born on the island of Nevis in the West Indies, Alexander Hamilton was an orphan and an American immigrant, long before he became one of the founding fathers. As a particularly astute teenager, he started managing imports and exports in the Virgin Islands. When the local townspeople of La Croix saw his potential, they raised funds for him to study in America. Once in America, he would become George Washington&rsquo;s right-hand man in the Revolutionary War and instrumental in the success of the early nation. <br /><br />Yet we don&rsquo;t want to give away too much. Go see Hamilton for yourself, playing at the <strong>SHN Orpheum Theater through August 5, 2017</strong>.</p>\n<p><br />--</p>\n<p><br />Like what you&rsquo;re reading?
