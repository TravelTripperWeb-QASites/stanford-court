  "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you have kids, you know. Just getting out the door &mdash; nevermind going on a #summervacay to an unfamiliar city &mdash; can feel like a monumental task. The logistics. The nap times. The snacks, strollers, and bags.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">That missing shoe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">But you also know that getting out is worth it. It&rsquo;s almost always a giant reset button for your mood - and some of the best memories you&rsquo;ll have with your kids are going to be made on the road.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It turns out we have a perfect city for making memories &hellip; even if that shoe is still missing. #sorry</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here are 3 tips for making the most of your SF summer vacation with the kiddos.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1501080320950\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_5092/media/2017-07-26-031655/how-to-do-sf-with-kids.jpg\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Pace yourself and park it</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">There&rsquo;s a ton to see and do in SF. Great, right? Yes! But you don&rsquo;t want to burn out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">One way 2 plan for a manageable pace would be to alternate leisurely, simple days at one of the many parks with adventures in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Approach your trip as a marathon instead of a sprint. Luckily, the city is close to some incredible National Parks: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm\">Muir Woods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm\">Presidio of San Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/index.htm\">Golden Gate National Recreational Area</a>, and <a href=\"https://goldengatepark.com/\">Golden Gate Park</a> to name a few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Golden Gate Park even features a special section called Koret Children&rsquo;s Quarter with concrete slides, climbing walls, and a playground.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">And if you want to have an especially low-key-but-fun morning or afternoon, just step out our front door and take a relaxing five-minute stroll down to <a href=\"http://sfrecpark.org/destination/collis-p-huntington-park/\">Huntington Park</a>. There a playground, beautiful landscaping, and the historic Flood Fountain are waiting for you.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sleep in and travel smart</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">When taking public transportation &mdash; known locally as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.sfmta.com/\">Muni</a>&rdquo; &mdash; do your best to avoid rush hour, especially if you have a stroller with you. Like all major cities, SF buses, trains, and even our cable cars get pretty jammed during peak hour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It&rsquo;s a good excuse to sleep in a bit, have a lazy breakfast with the kiddos, and maybe even stay out a little later in the day 2 avoid the packed rush-hour transit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1501053782585\" class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_5092/media/2017-07-26-031657/how-to-do-sf-with-kids-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Find time 4 learning &hellip; and great views</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SF has a great array of museums for adults and kids to enjoy. While you&rsquo;re in Golden Gate Park, check out <a href=\"https://deyoung.famsf.org/\">de Young Museum</a>, a fine arts museum with free observation towers that offer great views of the city, and the <a href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/\">California Academy of Sciences</a> with its awesome aquarium and rainforest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Kids can step inside a tornado at the <a href=\"https://www.exploratorium.edu/\">Exploratorium</a> or get creative at the <a href=\"http://bayareadiscoverymuseum.org/\">Bay Area Discovery Museum</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">#Bonus: Find even more great views at <a href=\"http://sfrecpark.org/destination/telegraph-hill-pioneer-park/coit-tower/\">Coit Tower</a>, which isn&rsquo;t a museum, but hey, we&rsquo;re making the rules here and this iconic SF landmark is definitely worth your time. The kids will love it.</p>"
