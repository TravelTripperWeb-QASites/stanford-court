Although the new number of flower wholesalers has dramatically dropped the last few years, you can still wandering through small paradises set right on the street. <br /><br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over a century ago, European immigrants could be seen pushing carts of flowers and lush plants through Manhattan. As demand increased, so did the number of sellers until a market was established between 26th and 29th Streets in the late 19th century. As the years went by, the area became known as the Flower District, a neighborhood where family-run flower businesses thrived.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, several of these businesses are still going strong in the same building where they first started. Taking a walk along 28th St. will fill your nostrils with delicious scents while your eyes feast not only on the gorgeous flowers and plants, but also on the architecture and history. &nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1522961130885\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" width=\"746\" height=\"497\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/large_royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/medium_royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/small_royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/xsmall_royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_14330/media/2018-04-05-164526/thumb_royalton-flower-orchid-show-new-york.jpg\" />New York Botanical Garden</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nybg.org/event/the-orchid-show/\"><strong>The Orchid Show</strong><br /></a><strong>When:</strong> March 3, 2018 to April 22, 2018<br />One of the most famous shows of NYBG returns this year with a great twist.
