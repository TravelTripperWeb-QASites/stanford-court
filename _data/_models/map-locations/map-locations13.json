  "details": "<p>Huntington Park is Nob Hill&rsquo;s signature green space. Surrounding its centerpiece&mdash;the Fountain of the Turtles&mdash; well manicured lawns, trees, and flowering plants, and ample benches welcome you to relax over views of Grace Cathedral and the city below. The pet and family-friendly park also offers a modern playground, Dancing Sprites&mdash;another noteworthy sculpture, and a remarkable link to the city&rsquo;s history&mdash;one of its borders is a granite wall that survived the 1906 earthquake and fire.</p>",
