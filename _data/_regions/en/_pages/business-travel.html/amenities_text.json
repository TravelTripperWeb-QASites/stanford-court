The hotel sits at the only intersection of San Francisco&rsquo;s legendary cable car lines, and our ideal location connects you with the entire city. Union Square. Chinatown. The Financial District. Everything just minutes away. Grab-and-go breakfast options and fair trade coffee fuel your mornings, especially if you&rsquo;re getting to work on one of our Blix ebikes.</p>"
