Head towards Union Square, and you&rsquo;ll find the recently expanded Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), and the cable cars (Insider&rsquo;s tip: board in Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf instead of downtown for shorter waits). Some other local favorites: lunch at the Ferry building, packing for a picnic at Mission Dolores Park, shopping on Fillmore Street, and long walks in the lush Presidio.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to see in San Francisco. Here are a few of our favorites.</p>"
