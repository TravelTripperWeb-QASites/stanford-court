Happy Hour 4-6pm</p>\n<h4>let's do dinner or drinks.</h4>\n<p>Seven Stills originally set out to make a craft whiskey for each of SF&rsquo;s seven hills. Now, they&rsquo;ve found a home at the summit of one of them. This casual spot on Nob Hill offers creative fare and brews you&rsquo;ll want to bring home. Equal parts brewery, distillery, and gastropub; their bold menu is designed to be &ldquo;whiskey friendly&rdquo; and shareable, broken up into &ldquo;Heads,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hearts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tails,&rdquo; offering appetizers, mains and desserts inspired by the distillation process. Local wines are on tap and exciting cocktails anchored by Seven Stills famous artisanal bitters are also available. The Steak + Whiskey flight is an irreverent take on tired traditional steakhouse dinners. Try something new, and share it. This is the innovative/laid-back/only-in-San-Francisco dining experience and tap room you&rsquo;re seeking.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Happenings&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dec 2nd- Deck the Hills Holiday Fair&nbsp;<em>Join Us</em></p>\n<p>Want to see where it&rsquo;s made?
