Stanford’s 1876 mansion became a relic of inspired luxury in the lush Nob Hill neighborhood until it was destroyed in a fire during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1912, investor Lucien H. Sly transformed the vacant lot into the posh Stanford Court Apartments. 60 years and a dramatic debut later, Stanford’s legacy stands today at the Stanford Court Hotel.</p>\n<p>Greeting guests at the entrance is [The Penguin?] by Benny Bufano, an artist who left his mark on many corners of San Francisco. His large, playful sculptures and devotion to free public art reflect the irreverent yet inclusive spirit of the city. In our lobby is a re-creation of Sallie Gardner at a Gallop, Eadward Muybridge’s innovative photography series, which was commissioned by Mr. Stanford himself. Consisting of 24 images shot in rapid succession, the series was a precursor to motion pictures, and showed that horses do indeed fly—if only for a brief moment, mid-gallop. A mural of the legendary car chase from Bullitt, starring Steve McQueen, an exhilarating scene considered to be one of the best of its kind in movie history is mounted on the ceiling. The nearly 11-minute sequence features two heavily modified four-speed Mustangs burning rubber across the city from Fisherman’s Wharf to Guadalupe Canyon Parkway over 50 years ago.</p>\n<p>Marrying maverick discovery with artistic expression, the art embodies the singular ethos that has come to define our city. We continue to champion San Francisco’s “boom town” spirit—the tenacity instilled by the risk takers and visionaries of the California Gold (and Silicon) Rush. Stanford Court offers the perfect mix of character, culture, tech, and style, with all the comforts of a great boutique hotel.</p>"
