Stanford&rsquo;s 1876 mansion became a relic of inspired luxury in the lush Nob Hill neighborhood until it was destroyed in a fire during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1912, investor Lucien H. Sly transformed the vacant lot into the posh Stanford Court Apartments. 60 years and a dramatic debut later, Stanford&rsquo;s legacy stands today at the Stanford Court Hotel.</p>\n<p>Now, we continue to champion San Francisco&rsquo;s &ldquo;boom town&rdquo; spirit&mdash;the tenacity instilled by the risk takers and visionaries of the California Gold (and Silicon) Rush. We get it. You want a residential experience in Nob Hill. Well, we wanted to create a place that felt like the best version of home&hellip;a place we&rsquo;d happily welcome our friends (with housekeeping!). Stanford Court offers the perfect mix of character, tech, and style, with all the comforts of a great boutique hotel in a &ldquo;real&rdquo; neighborhood. From the Gold Rush to the tech boom, a unique collection of risk takers, visionaries, and renegades have written the story of San Francisco. The walls of Stanford Court honor this ongoing legacy.</p>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.05em;\">&nbsp;</span></div>"
