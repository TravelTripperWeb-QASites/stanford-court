More than a century later, our privileged perch is still the place to be in San Francisco&mdash;where you can see what&rsquo;s on the horizon of a city on the edge of innovation. Stanford Court Hotel was aptly named after a forward-thinking railroad tycoon who helped lay the tracks for the first transcontinental railroad. Not coincidentally, the hotel sits at the only intersection of San Francisco&rsquo;s legendary cable car lines.</p>\n<p>Now, we continue to champion San Francisco&rsquo;s &ldquo;boom town&rdquo; spirit&mdash;the tenacity instilled by the risk takers and visionaries of the California Gold (and Silicon) Rush. We get it. You want a residential experience in Nob Hill. Well, we wanted to create a place that felt like the best version of home&hellip;a place we&rsquo;d happily welcome our friends (with housekeeping!). Stanford Court offers the perfect mix of character, tech, and style, with all the comforts of a great boutique hotel in a &ldquo;real&rdquo; neighborhood.</p>"
