            <p class="d-block d-lg-none">Stanford Court is a contemporary conductor, linking modern mavericks with the best of San Francisco. Those who first headed west inspire us, and each of our 400 rooms and suites reflects their renegade spirit. Views of the skyline extend as far as Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge, while streamlined design meets cutting-edge technologies for contemporary trailblazers. Our ideal location lets you explore all San Francisco has to offer. Union Square. Chinatown. The Financial District. Everything just minutes away.</p>

            <h3>TRUE TO OUR ROOTS</h3>
            <p>Like our predecessors, we dare to dream big and connect people.</p>
<p>It all started with Leland Stanford, an industrial railroad tycoon who built the Central Pacific Railroad—a 19th century highway that catalyzed the exchange of new cultures and ideas. Stanford’s 1876 mansion became a relic of inspired luxury in the lush Nob Hill neighborhood until it was destroyed in a fire during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1912, investor Lucien H. Sly transformed the vacant lot into the posh Stanford Court Apartments. 60 years and a dramatic debut later, Stanford’s legacy stands today at the Stanford Court Hotel. </p>

<p>Now, we continue to champion San Francisco’s “boom town” spirit—the tenacity instilled by the risk takers and visionaries of the California Gold (and Silicon) Rush.  We get it. You want a residential experience in Nob Hill. Well, we wanted to create a place that felt like the best version of home…a place we’d happily welcome our friends (with housekeeping!). Stanford Court offers the perfect mix of character, tech, and style, with all the comforts of a great boutique hotel in a “real” neighborhood. </p>

        <p>Wander our halls and engage with video art, photography, oil paintings, murals, and more. Our immersive arts program enlivens our walls (and ceilings), connecting you with San Francisco’s creative community and culture. We partner with Daylighted, San Francisco’s premier fine arts consultancy, to bring new art from the Bay Area to our lobby. A dynamic selection of work is presented in our digital gallery across three 75” screens—featuring mixed media pieces by photographers and painters including Derek James Lynch, Mike Kepka, and a section of artists from Artspan, a renowned organization that supports local talent. Daylighted’s curators carefully select individual pieces monthly, so the rotation always stays fresh. </p>
        <p>Intuitive and thought provoking, our SmArtGallery technology delivers an interactive user experience. Swipe to learn more about the pieces that resonate with you most, or take control of the screen via our tablet kiosks. You don’t even have to leave your he(art) in San Francisco. Simply select, order, and send artwork home with a couple clicks.</p>
