      <p>It’s cool. We’ll point you in the right direction. Stanford Court overlooks the city from Nob Hill, one of San Francisco’s most sought-after neighborhoods. It’s a great spot with some spectacular views, all just blocks away from Union Square. Whether you’re headed to the Financial District, looking for the best dim sum in Chinatown, or meeting up at the Moscone center, everything you need is easily within walking distance.</p>
